He added: This is a stroke of the Devil, so observe your menses for six or seven days, Allah alone knows which it should be; then wash. And when you see that you are purified and quite clean, pray during twenty-three or twenty-four days and nights and fast, for that will be enough for you, and do so every month, just as women menstruate and are purified at the time of their menstruation and their purification. But if you are strong enough to delay the noon (Zuhr) prayer and advance the afternoon ('Asr) prayer, to wash, and then combine the noon and the afternoon prayer; to delay the sunset prayer and advance the night prayer, to wash, and then combine the two prayers, do so: and to wash at dawn, do so: and fast if you are able to do so if possible.

And now verily We shall make thee turn (in prayer) toward a qiblah which is dear to thee. So turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship, and ye (O Muslims), wherever ye may be, turn your face (when ye pray) toward it\" (ii.144).

Then Allah, the Exalted, revealed the verse: \".......Fasting was prescribed for those before you, that ye may ward off (evil)......and for those who can afford it there is a ransom: the feeding of a man in need (ii.183-84). If someone wished to keep the fast, he would keep the fast; if someone wished to abandon the fast, he would feed an indigent every day; it would do for him. But this was changed. Allah, the Exalted, revealed: \"The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur'an ..........(let him fast the same) number of other days\" (ii.185). Hence the fast was prescribed for the one who was present in the month (of Ramadan) and the traveller was required to atone (for them); feeding (the indigent) was prescribed for the old man and woman who were unable to fast.

When we reached him, he asked about the people (who had come to visit him). When my turn came I said “I am Muhammad bin Ali bin Hussain. He patted my head with his hand and undid my upper then lower buttons. He then placed his hand between my nipples and in those days I was a young boy.” He then said “welcome to you my nephew, ask what you like. I questioned him he was blind. The time of prayer came and he stood wrapped in a mantle. Whenever he placed it on his shoulders its ends fell due to its shortness. He led us in prayer while his mantle was placed on a rack by his side. I said “tell me about the Hajj of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ).”He signed with his hand and folded his fingers indicating nine. He then said Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) remained nine years (at Madeenah ) during which he did not perform Hajj, then made a public announcement in the tenth year to the effect that the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) was about to (go to) perform Hajj. A large number of people came to Madeenah everyone desiring to follow him and act like him. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) went out and we too went out with him till we reached Dhu Al Hulaifah. Asma’ daughter of ‘Umais gave birth to Muhammad bin Abi Bakr. She sent message to Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) asking him What should I do?He replied “take a bath, bandage your private parts with a cloth and put on ihram.” The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then prayed (in the masjid) and mounted Al Qaswa’ and his she Camel stood erect with him on its back. Jabir said “I saw (a large number of) people on mounts and on foot in front of him and a similar number on his right side and a similar number on his left side and a similar number behind him. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) was among us, the Qur’an was being revealed to him and he knew its interpretation. Whatever he did, we did it. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then raised his voice declaring Allaah’s unity and saying “Labbaik ( I am at thy service), O Allaah, labbaik, labbaik, Thou hast no partner praise and grace are Thine and the Dominion. Thou hast no partner. The people too raised their voices in talbiyah which they used to utter. But the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) did not forbid them anything. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) continued his talbiyah. Jabir said “We did not express our intention of performing anything but Hajj, being unaware of ‘Umrah (at that season), but when we came with him to the House (the Ka’bah), he touched the corner (and made seven circuits) walking quickly with pride in three of them and walking ordinarily in four. Then going forward to the station of Abraham he recited “And take the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.” (While praying two rak’ahs) he kept the station between him and the House. The narrator said My father said that Ibn Nufail and ‘Uthman said I do not know that he (Jabir) narrated it from anyone except the Prophet (ﷺ). The narrator Sulaiman said I do not know but he (Jabir) said “The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) used to recite in the two rak’ahs “Say, He is Allaah, one” and “Say O infidels”. He then returned to the House (the ka’bah) and touched the corner after which he went out by the gate to Al Safa’. When he reached near Al Safa’ he recited “Al Safa’ and Al Marwah are among the indications of Allaah” and he added “We begin with what Allaah began with”. He then began with Al Safa’ and mounting it till he could see the House (the Ka’bah) he declared the greatness of Allaah and proclaimed his Unity. He then said “there is no god but Allaah alone, Who alone has fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates. He then made supplication in the course of that saying such words three times. He then descended and walked towards Al Marwah and when his feet came down into the bottom of the valley, he ran, and when he began to ascend he walked till he reached Al Marwah. He did at al Marwah as he had done at Al Safa’ and when he came to Al Marwah for the last time, he said “If I had known before what I have come to know afterwards regarding this matter of mine, I would not have brought sacrificial animals but made it an ‘Umrah, so if any of you has no sacrificial animals, he may take off ihram and treat it as an ‘Umrah. All the people then took off ihram and clipped their hair except the Prophet (ﷺ) and those who had brought sacrificial animals. Suraqah (bin Malik) bin Ju’sham then got up and asked Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ)does this apply to the present year or does it apply for ever? The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) interwined his fingers and said “The ‘Umarh has been incorporated in Hajj. Adding ‘No’, but forever and ever. ‘Ali came from Yemen with the sacrificial animals of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and found Fathima among one of those who had taken off their ihram. She said put on colored clothes and stained her eyes with collyrium. ‘Ali disliked (this action of her) and asked Who commanded you for this? She said “My father”. Jabir said ‘Ali said at Iraq I went to Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) to complain against Fathima for what she had done and to ask the opinion of Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) about which she mentioned to me. I informed him that I disliked her action and that thereupon she said to me “My father commanded me to do this.” He said “She spoke the truth, she spoke the truth.” What did you say when you put on ihram for Hajj? I said O Allaah, I put on ihram for the same purpose for which Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) has put it on. He said I have sacrificial animals with me, so do not take off ihram. He (Jabir) said “The total of those sacrificial animals brought by ‘Ali from Yemen and of those brought by the Prophet (ﷺ) from Madeenah was one hundred.” Then all the people except the Prophet (ﷺ) and those who had with them the sacrificial animals took off ihram and clipped their hair. When the 8th of Dhu Al Hijjah (Yaum Al Tarwiyah) came, they went towards Mina having pit on ihram for Hajj and the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) rode and prayed at Mina the noon, afternoon, sunset, night and dawn prayers. After that he waited a little till the sun rose and gave orders for a tent of hair to be set up at Namrah. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then sent out and the Quraish did not doubt that he would halt at Al Mash ‘ar Al Haram at Al Muzdalifah, as the Quraish used to do in the pre Islamic period but he passed on till he came to ‘Arafah and found that the tent had been setup at Namrah. There he dismounted and when the sun had passed the meridian he ordered Al Qaswa’ to be brought and when it was saddled for him, he went down to the bottom of the valley and addressed the people saying “Your lives and your property must be respected by one another like the sacredness of this day of yours in the month of yours in this town of yours. Lo! Everything pertaining to the pre Islamic period has been put under my feet and claims for blood vengeance belonging to the pre Islamic period have been abolished. The first of those murdered among us whose blood vengeance I permit is the blood vengeance of ours (according to the version of the narrator ‘Uthman, the blood vengeance of the son of Rabi’ah and according to the version of the narrator Sulaiman the blood vengeance of the son of Rabi’ah bin Al Harith bin ‘Abd Al Muttalib). Some (scholars) said “he was suckled among Banu Sa’d(i.e., he was brought up among Bani Sa’d) and then killed by Hudhail. The usury of the pre Islamic period is abolished and the first of usury I abolish is our usury, the usury of ‘Abbas bin ‘Abd Al Muttalib for it is all abolished. Fear Allaah regarding women for you have got them under Allah’s security and have the right to intercourse with them by Allaah’s word. It is a duty from you on them not to allow anyone whom you dislike to lie on your beds but if they do beat them, but not severely. You are responsible for providing them with food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you something by which if you hold to it you will never again go astray, that is Allaah’s Book. You will be asked about me, so what will you say? They replied “We testify that you have conveyed and fulfilled the message and given counsel. Then raising his forefinger towards the sky and pointing it at the people, he said “O Allaah! Be witness, O Allaah! Be witness, O Allaah! Be witness! Bilal then uttered the call to prayer and the iqamah and he prayed the noon prayer, he then uttered the iqamah and he prayed the afternoon prayer, engaging in no prayer between the two. He then mounted (his she Camel) al Qaswa’ and came to the place of standing , making his she Camel Al Qaswa‘ turn its back to the rocks and having the path taken by those who went on foot in front of him and he faced the qiblah. He remained standing till sunset when the yellow light had somewhat gone and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He took Usamah up behind him and picked the reins of Al Qaswa’ severely so much so that its head was touching the front part of the saddle. Pointing with is right hand he was saying “Calmness, O People! Calmness, O people. Whenever he came over a mound (of sand) he let loose its reins a little so that it could ascend. He then came to Al Muzdalifah where he combined the sunset and night prayers, with one adhan and two iqamahs. The narrator ‘Uthamn said He did not offer supererogatory prayers between them. The narrators are then agreed upon the version He then lay down till dawn and prayed the dawn prayer when the morning light was clear. The narrator Sulaiman said with one adhan and one iqamah. The narrators are then agreed upon the version He then mounted Al Qaswa’ and came to Al Mash’ar Al Haram and ascended it. The narrators ‘Uthaman and Sulaiman said He faced the qiblah praised Allaah, declared His greatness, His uniqueness. ‘Uthamn added in his version and His Unity and kept standing till the day was very clear. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then went quickly before the sun rose , taking Al Fadl bin ‘Abbas behind him. He was a man having beautiful hair, white and handsome color. When the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) went quickly, the women in the howdas also began to pass him quickly. Al Fadl began to look at them. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) placed his hand on the face of Al Fadl , but Al fadl turned his face towards the other side. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) also turned away his hand to the other side. Al Fadl also turned his face to the other side looking at them till he came to (the Valley of) Muhassir. He urged the Camel a little and following a middle road which comes out at the greatest jamrah, he came to the jamrah which is beside the tree and he threw seven small pebbles at this (jamrah) saying “Allah is most great” each time he threw a pebble like bean seeds. He threw them from the bottom of the valley. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then went to the place of the sacrifice and sacrificed sixty three Camels with his own hand. He then commanded ‘Ali who sacrificed the remainder and he shared him and his sacrificial animals. After that he ordered that a piece of flesh from each Camel should be put in a pot and when it was cooked the two of them ate some of it and drank some of its broth. The narrator Sulaiman said the he mounted afterwards the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) went quickly to the House (the Ka’bah) and prayed the noon prayer at Makkah. He came to Banu ‘Abd Al Muttalib who were supplying water at Zamzam and said draw water Banu ‘Abd Al Muttalib were it not that people would take from you the right to draw water, I would draw it along with you.

I did not find any one of the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) more devoted to worship and more hospitable than AbuHurayrah. One day I was with him when he was sitting on his bed. He had a purse which contained pebbles or kernels. A black slave-girl of his was sitting below. Counting them he was glorifying Allah. When the pebbles or the kernels in the purse were finished, she gathered them and put them again in the purse, and gave it to him. He said: Should I not tell you about me and about the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? I said: Yes. He said: Once when I was laid up with fever in the mosque, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and entered the mosque, and said: Who saw the youth of ad-Daws. He said this three times. A man said: Messenger of Allah, there he is, laid up with fever on one side of the mosque. He moved, walking forward till he reached me. He placed his hand on me. He had a kind talk with me, and I rose. He then began to walk till he reached the place where he used to offer his prayer. He paid his attention to the people. There were two rows of men and one row of women, or two rows of women and one row of men (the narrator is doubtful). He then said: If Satan makes me forget anything during the prayer, the men should glorify Allah, and the women should clap their hands. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then prayed and he did not forget anything during the prayer. He said: Be seated in your places, be seated in your places. The narrator, Musa, added the word \"here\". He then praised Allah and exalted Him, and said: Now to our topic. The agreed version begins: He then said: Is there any man among you who approaches his wife, closes the door, covers himself with a curtain, and he is concealed with the curtain of Allah? They replied: Yes. He said: later he sits and says: I did so-and-so; I did so-and-so. The people kept silence. He then turned to the women and said (to them): Is there any woman among you who narrates it? They kept silence. Then a girl fell on one of her knees. The narrator, Mu'ammil, said in his version: a buxom girl. She raised her head before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) so that he could see her and listen to her. She said: Messenger of Allah, they (the men) describe the secrets (of intercourse) and they (the women) also describe the secrets (of intercourse) to the people. He said: Do you know what the similitude is? He said: The likeness of this act is the likeness of a female Satan who meets the male Satan on the roadside; he fulfils his desire with her while the people are looking at him. Beware! The perfume of men is that whose smell becomes visible and its colour does not appear. Beware! The perfume of women is that whose colour becomes visible and whose smell is not obvious. AbuDawud said: From here I remembered this tradition from Mu'ammil and Musa: Beware! No man should lie with another man, no woman should lie with another woman except with one's child or father. He also mentioned a third which I have forgotten. This has been mentioned in the version of Musaddad, but I do not remember it as precisely as I like.

(They wrote): You gave protection to our companion. We swear by Allah, you should fight him or expel him, or we shall come to you in full force, until we kill your fighters and appropriate your women. When this (news) reached Abdullah ibn Ubayy and those who were worshippers of idols, with him they gathered together to fight the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When this news reached the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he visited them and said: The threat of the Quraysh to you has reached its end. They cannot contrive a plot against you, greater than what you yourselves intended to harm you. Are you willing to fight your sons and brethren? When they heard this from the Prophet (ﷺ), they scattered. This reached the infidels of the Quraysh. The infidels of the Quraysh again wrote (a letter) to the Jews after the battle of Badr: You are men of weapons and fortresses. You should fight our companion or we shall deal with you in a certain way. And nothing will come between us and the anklets of your women. When their letter reached the Prophet (ﷺ), they gathered Banu an-Nadir to violate the treaty. They sent a message to the Prophet (ﷺ): Come out to us with thirty men from your companions, and thirty rabbis will come out from us till we meet at a central place where they will hear you. If they testify to you and believe in you, we shall believe in you. The narrator then narrated the whole story. When the next day came, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out in the morning with an army, and surrounded them. He told them: I swear by Allah, you will have no peace from me until you conclude a treaty with me. But they refused to conclude a treaty with him. He therefore fought them the same day. Next he attacked Banu Quraysh with an army in the morning, and left Banu an-Nadir. He asked them to sign a treaty and they signed it. He turned away from them and attacked Banu an-Nadir with an army. He fought with them until they agreed to expulsion. Banu an-Nadir were deported, and they took with them whatever their camels could carry, that is, their property, the doors of their houses, and their wood.

He said: He had nothing. It was I who managed it on his behalf since the day Allah made him Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) until he died. When a Muslim man came to him and he found him naked, he ordered me (to clothe him). I would go, borrow (some money), and purchase a cloak for him. I would then clothe him and feed him. A man from the polytheists met me and said: I am well off, Bilal. Do not borrow money from anyone except me. So I did accordingly. One day when I performed ablution and stood up to make call to prayer, the same polytheist came along with a body of merchants. When he saw me, he said: O Abyssinian. I said: I am at your service. He met me with unpleasant looks and said harsh words to me. He asked me: Do you know how many days remain in the completion of this month? I replied: The time is near. He said: Only four days remain in the completion of this month. I shall then take that which is due from you (i.e. loan), and then shall return you to tend the sheep as you did before. I began to think in my mind what people think in their minds (on such occasions). When I offered the night prayer, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) returned to his family. I sought permission from him and he gave me permission. I said: Messenger of Allah, may my parents be sacrificed for you, the polytheist from whom I used to borrow money said to me such-and-such. Neither you nor I have anything to pay him for me, and he will disgrace me. So give me permission to run away to some of those tribes who have recently embraced Islam until Allah gives His Apostle (ﷺ) something with which he can pay (the debt) for me. So I came out and reached my house. I placed my sword, waterskin (or sheath), shoes and shield near my head. When dawn broke, I intended to be on my way. All of a sudden I saw a man running towards me and calling: Bilal, return to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). So I went till I reached him. I found four mounts kneeling on the ground with loads on them. I sought permission. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: Be glad, Allah has made arrangements for the payment (of your debt). He then asked: Have you not seen the four mounts kneeling on the ground? I replied: Yes. He said: You may have these mounts and what they have on them. There are clothes and food on them, presented to me by the ruler of Fadak. Take them away and pay off your debt. I did so. He then mentioned the rest of the tradition. I then went to the mosque and found that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting there. I greeted him. He asked: What benefit did you have from your property? I replied: Allah Most High paid everything which was due from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Nothing remains now. He asked: Did anything remain (from that property)? I said: Yes. He said: Look, if you can give me some comfort from it, for I shall not visit any member of my family until you give me some comfort from it. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered the night prayer, he called me and said: What is the position of that which you had with you (i.e. property)? I said: I still have it, no one came to me. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed the night in the mosque. He then narrated the rest of the tradition. Next day when he offered the night prayer, he called me and asked: What is the position of that which you had (i.e. the rest of the property)? I replied: Allah has given you comfort from it, Messenger of Allah. He said: Allah is Most Great, and praised Allah, fearing lest he should die while it was with him.

He had a piece of cloth on his head to protect himself from the sun. I asked: Who is this important man? People said: This is Anas ibn Malik. When the bier was placed, Anas stood and led the funeral prayer over him while I was just behind him, and there was no obstruction between me and him.

They said: AbuHamzah, (here is the bier of) an Ansari woman. They brought her near him and there was a green cupola-shaped structure over her bier. He stood opposite her hips and led the funeral prayer over her as he had led it over the man. He then sat down. Al-Ala' ibn Ziyad asked: AbuHamzah, did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say the funeral prayer over the dead as you have done, uttering four takbirs (Allah is Most Great) over her, and standing opposite the head of a man and the hips of a woman? He replied: Yes. He asked: AbuHamzah, did you fight with the Messenger of Allah? He replied: Yes. I fought with him in the battle of Hunayn. The polytheists came out and invaded us so severely that we saw our horses behind our backs. Among the people (i.e. the unbelievers) there was a man who was attacking us, and striking and wounding us (with his sword). Allah then defeated them. They were then brought and began to take the oath of allegiance to him for Islam. A man from among the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) said: I make a vow to myself that if Allah brings the man who was striking us (with his sword) that day, I shall behead him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) kept silent and the man was brought (as a captive). When he saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he said: Messenger of Allah, I have repented to Allah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stopped (for a while) receiving his oath of allegiance, so that the other man might fulfil his vow. But the man began to wait for the order of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for his murder. He was afraid of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to kill him. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw that he did not do anything, he received his oath of allegiance. The man said: Messenger of Allah, what about my vow? He said: I stopped (receiving his oath of allegiance) today so that you might fulfil your vow. He said: Messenger of Allah, why did you not give any signal to me? The Prophet (ﷺ) said: It is not worthy of a Prophet to give a signal. AbuGhalib said: I asked (the people) about Anas standing opposite the hips of a woman. They told me that this practice was due to the fact that (in the days of the Prophet) there were no cupola-shaped structures over the biers of women.

During these trails the Quran would be easy so much so that every believer, hypocrite, man, woman, young, grown up, slave and free man will learn it. Then a man might say: What happened with the people that they do not follow me while I read the Quran? They are not going to follow me until I introduce a novelty for them other than it. So avoid that which is innovated (in religion), for whichever is innovated is an error.

'Abd al-Aziz asking him about Divine decree. He wrote to him: To begin with, I enjoin upon you to fear Allah, to be moderate in (obeying) His Command, to follow the sunnah (practice) of His Prophet (ﷺ) and to abandon the novelties which the innovators introduced after his Sunnah has been established and they were saved from its trouble (i.e. novelty or innovation) ; so stick to Sunnah, for it is for you, if Allah chooses, a protection ; then you should know that any innovation which the people introduced was refuted long before it on the basis of some authority or there was some lesson in it, for the Sunnah was introduced by the people who were conscious of the error, slip, foolishness, and extremism in case of (the sunnah) was opposed. So accept for yourself what the people (in the past) had accepted for themselves, for they had complete knowledge of whatever they were informed, and by penetrating insight they forbade (to do prohibited acts); they had more strength (than us) to disclose the matters (of religion), and they were far better (than us) by virtue of their merits. If right guidance is what you are following, then you outstriped them to it. And if you say whatever the novelty occurred after them was introduced by those who followed the way other then theirs and disliked them. It is they who actually outstripped, and talked about it sufficiently, and gave a satisfactory explanation for it. Below them there is no place for exhaustiveness, and above them there is no place for elaborating things. Some people shortened the matter more than they had done, and thus they turned away (from them), and some people raised the matter more than they had done, and thus they exaggerated. They were on right guidance between that. You have written (to me) asking about confession of Divine decree, you have indeed approached a person who is well informed of it, with the will of Allah. I know what whatever novelty people have brought in, and whatever innovation people have introduced are not more manifest and more established than confession of Divine decree. The ignorant people (i.e. the Arabs before Islam) in pre-Islamic times have mentioned it ; they talked about it in their speeches and in their poetry. They would console themselves for what they lost, and Islam then strengthened it (i.e. belief in Divine decree). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not mention it in one or two traditions, but the Muslims heard it from him, and they talked of it from him, and they talked of it during his lifetime and after his death. They did so out of belief and submission to their Lord and thinking themselves weak. There is nothing which is not surrounded by His knowledge, and not counted by His register and not destined by His decree. Despite that, it has been strongly mentioned in His Book: from it they have derived it, and from it they have and so ? they also read in it what you read, and they knew its interpretation of which you are ignorant. After that they said: All this is by writing and decreeing. Distress has been written down, and what has been destined will occur ; what Allah wills will surely happen, and what He does not will will not happen. We have no power to harm or benefit ourselves.
