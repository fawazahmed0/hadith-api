			"text": "Abu Hurairah said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in one of the evening (‘Asha) prayers, noon or afternoon. He led us in two Rak’ahs and gave the salutation. He then got up going towards a piece of wood which was placed in the front part of the mosque. He placed his hands upon it, one on the other, looking from his face as if he were angry. The people came out hastily saying: the prayer has been shortened. Abu Bakr and ‘Umar were among the people, but they were too afraid to speak to him. A man whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would call “ the possessor of arms” (Dhu al-Yadain) stood up (asking him): Have you forgotten. The Messenger of Allah, or has the prayer been shortened? He said: I have neither forgotten nor has it been shortened. He said : Messenger of Allah , you have forgotten. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned towards the people and asked : did the possessor of arms speak the truth? They made a sign , that is, yes. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) returned to his place and prayed the remaining two Rak’ahs, then gave the salutation; he then uttered the takbir and prostrated himself as usual or prolonged. He then raised his head and uttered the takbir; then he uttered the takbir and made prostration as usual or made longer (prostration). Then he raised his head his and uttered the takbir (Allah is most great). The narrator Muhammad was asked : Did he give the salutation (while prostrating) dueto forgetfulness? He said : I do not remember it from Abu Hurairah. But we Are sure that ‘Imran b. Husain (in his version) said; he then gave the salutation",
