Husain said:then he gave the salutation.” The narrator said: I asked; What about the Tashahud? He replied: I did not hear thing about the tashahhud, but it is more liking to me that one should recite the tashahhud. This version has not the words “whom he called the possessor of arms(Dhu al-yadain).” Nor the words “they made a sign,” nor the word “anger”. The tradition narrated by Hammad from Ayyub is more perfect",
