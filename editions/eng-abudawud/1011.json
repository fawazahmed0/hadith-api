This version goes :the Prophet (ﷺ) uttered the takbir and prostrated himself (in a tradition relating to the incidence of the possessor of arms [Dhu al-yadain]). The narrator Hisham, I,e, Ibn Hassan said: he uttered the takbir ; then he uttered the takbir and prostrated himself. Abu Dawud said : This tradition has also been narrated by Habib b. al-shahid, Humaid, Yunus, and Asim b. al-Ahwal, from Muhammad on the authority of abu Hurairah none of them mentioned what Hammad b. Zaid mentioned from from Hisham that he uttered the takbir; then uttered the takbir and prostrated himself. Hammad b. Sulaimah and Abu BAkr b. ‘Ayyash also narrated this tradition from Hisham, but they did not narrate from him what HAmmad b. zaid narrated that he uttered the takbir and again uttered the takbir",
