If the devil comes to him, and tells him (suggests him): \"You have been defiled,\" he should say: \"You have told a lie,\" except that he feels smell with his nose, or sound with his ears (then his ablution will break). These are the wording; of the tradition reported by Aban. Abu Dawud said: Ma'mar and 'Abi b. al-Mubarak mentioned the name \"Iyad b. Hilal and al-Awza'i mentioned the name of Iyad b. Abi Zuhair",
