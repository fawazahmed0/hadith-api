He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out wearing old clothes in a humble and lowly manner until he reached the place of prayer. He then ascended the pulpit, but he did not deliver the sermon as you deliver (usually). He remained engaged in making supplication, showing humbleness (to Allah) and uttering the takbir (Allah is most great). He then offered two rak'ahs of prayer as done on the 'Id (festival). Abu Dawud said: This is the version of al-Nufail. What is correct is Ibn Utbah's",
