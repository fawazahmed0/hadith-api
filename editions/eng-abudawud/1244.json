One row was behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the other faced the enemy. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led them in one rak'ah,and then the other section came and took their place; they went and faced the enemy. The Prophet (ﷺ) led them in one rak'ah and uttered the salutation. They stood up and prayed the second rak'ah by themselves and uttered the salutation and went away; they took the place of the other section facing the enemy. They came back and took their place. They prayed one rak'ah by themselves and then uttered the salutation",
