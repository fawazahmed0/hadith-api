			"text": "Narrated 'Abd Allah b. 'Abbas:That he spent a night with Maimunah, wife of the Prophet (ﷺ), who was also his (Ibn 'Abbas's) maternal aunt. I lay towards the width of the pillow and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his wife slept towards its length. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) slept. When half the night passed, or a little before it or a little after it, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) awoke and began to rub his face (eyes) to remove the sleep. He then recited ten verses from the last part of Surah 'Al-Imran. Hen then came to a bag of water that was hanging. He performed ablution from it and performed his ablution well. He then stood up and prayed. I also got up and did as he did. I then went and stood at his side. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) placed his right hand upon my head and took me by my ear twisting it. He then prayed two rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs. The narrator al-Qa'nabi said: Six times. He observed the witr prayer, and then slept until the mu'adhdhin came. He got up and prayed two light rak'ahs and then came out and offered the dawn prayer",
