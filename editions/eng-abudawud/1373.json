He then prayed on the following night, and the people gathered in large numbers. They gathered on the third night too, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not come out to them. When the morning came, he said: I witnessed what you did, and nothing prevented me from coming out to you except that I feared that this (prayer) might be prescribed to you. That was in Ramadan",
