			"text": "Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr: A man came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: Teach me to read the Qur'an, Messenger of Allah. He said: Read three surahs which begin with A.L.R. He said: My age is advanced, my mind has become dull (i.e. memory has grown weak), and my tongue has grown heavy). So he said: Then read three surahs which begin with H.M. He repeated the same words. So he said: Read three surahs which begin with the \"Glorification of Allah\". But he repeated the same excuse. The man then said: Teach me a comprehensive surah, Messenger of Allah. The Prophet (ﷺ) taught him Surah (99). \"When the Earth is shaken with her earthquake\". When he finished it, the man said: By Him Who sent you with truth, I shall never add anything to it. Then man then went away. The Prophet (ﷺ) said twice: The man received salvation",
