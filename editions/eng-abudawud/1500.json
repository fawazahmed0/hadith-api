He (the Prophet) said: I tell you something which would be easier (or more excellent) for you than that. He said (it consisted of saying): \"Glory be to Allah\" as many times as the number of that which He has created in Heaven; \"Glory be to Allah\" as many times as the number of that which He has created on Earth; \"Glory be to Allah\" as many times as the number of that which He has created between them; \"Glory be to Allah\" as many times as the number of that which He is creating; \"Allah is most great\" a similar number of times; \"Praise (be to Allah)\" a similar number of times; and \"There is no god but Allah\" a similar number of times; \"There is no might and no power except in Allah\" a similar number of times",
