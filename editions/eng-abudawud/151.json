			"text": "‘Urwah b. al-Mughirah reported his father as saying :We accompanied the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to a caravan, and I had a jug of water. He went to relieve himself and came back. I came to him with the jug of water and poured upon him. He washed his hands and face. He had a tight-sleeved Syrian woolen gown. He tried to get his forearms out, but the sleeve of the gown was very narrow, so he brought his hands out from under the gown. I then bent down to take off his socks. But he said to me : Leave them, for my feet were clean when I put them in, and he only wiped over them. Yunus said on the authority of al-Sha’bi that ‘Urwah narrated his tradition from his father before him, and his father reported it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)",
