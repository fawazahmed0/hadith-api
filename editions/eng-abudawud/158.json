He replied: For two days too. He again asked: And for three days? He replied: Yes, as long as you wish. Abu Dawud said: Another version says: He asked him about the period until he reached the period of seven days. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) replied: Yes, as long as you wish (i.e. there is no time limit). Abu Dawud said: There is a variance in the chain of narrators of this tradition. The chain is not strong. Another chain from Yahya b. Ayyub is also disputed",
