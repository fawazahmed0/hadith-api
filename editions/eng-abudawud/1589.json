He said please those who collect the sadaqah from you. They asked Even if they wrong us, Messenger of Allah? He replied Please those who collect sadaqah from you. The version of ‘Uthman adds “Even if you are wronged”. Abu Kamil said in this version “Jarir said No collector of zakat returned from me since I heard this from the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ), but he was pleased with me.”",
