			"text": "Narrated AbuHurayrah: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said something similar as mentioned in the preceding tradition. This version adds: But the poor man (miskin) who abstains from begging from the people is one (according to the version of Musaddad who does not get enough so that he may not beg from the people, nor is his need known to the people, so that alms be given to him. This is the one who has been deprived. Musaddad did not mention the words \"one who avoids begging from the people.\" Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by Muhammad bin Thawr and 'Abd al-Razzaq on the authority of Ma'mar. They mentioned that the word \"deprived\" is the statement of al-Zuhri, and this is more sound)",
