He asked : Messenger of Allah, what about a stray sheep? He replied: Take it; that is for you, or for your brother, or for the wolf. He again asked: Messenger of Allah, What about stray camels? The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) became angry so much so that his cheeks became red or ( the narrator is doubtful) his face became red. He replied: What have you to do with them?
