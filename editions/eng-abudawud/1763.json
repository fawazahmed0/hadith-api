			"text": "Ibn Abbas said:The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) sent a man of al-Aslam tribe and sent with him eighteen sacrificial camels (as offering to Makkah). What do you think if any one of them becomes fatigued. He replied : You should sacrifice it then dye its shoe with its blood, then mark with it on its neck. But you or any of your companions should not eat out of it. Abu Dawud said: The following words of this tradition are not supported by any other tradition “You should not eat of it yourself nor any of your companions”. The version of `Abdal Warith has the words “then hang it in its neck” instead of the words “mark or strike with it”. Abu Dawud said I heard Abu Salamah say if the chain of narrators and the meaning are correct, it is sufficient for you",
