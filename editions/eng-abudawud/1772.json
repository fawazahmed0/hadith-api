			"text": "Ubayd ibn Jurayj said to Abdullah ibn Umar:AbuAbdurRahman, I saw you doing things which I did not see being done by your companions. He asked: What are they, Ibn Jurayj? He replied: I saw you touching only the two Yamani corners; and I saw you wearing shoes having no hair; I saw you dyeing in yellow colour; and I saw you wearing ihram on the eighth of Dhul-Hijjah, whereas the people had worn ihram when they sighted the moon. Abdullah ibn Umar replied: As regards the corners, I have not seen the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) touching anything (in the Ka'bah) but the two Yamani corners. As for the tanned leather shoes, I have seen the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wearing tanned leather shoes, and he would wear them after ablution. Therefore I like to wear them. As regards wearing yellow, I have seen the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wearing yellow, so I like to wear with it. As regards shouting the talbiyah, I have seen the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raising his voice in talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back",
