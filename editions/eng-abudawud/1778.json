			"text": "Ai’shah said :We went out along with The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) when the moon of the month of Dhu al-Hijja was going to appear shortly. When he reached Dhu al-Hulaifah he said : Anyone who wants to perform Hajj should raise his voice in Talbiyah for Hajj (after wearing Ihram); and he who wants to perform `Umrah should raise his voice in talbiyah for an `Umrah. The narrator Musa in the version of Wuhaib reported him (the Prophet) as saying if there were no sacrificial animals with me, I would raise my voice in talbiyah for an `Umrah. But according to the version of Hammad bin Salamah, he said as for myself, I shall raise my voice in talbiyah for Hajj because I have sacrificial animal with me. The agreed version goes I (Ai’shah) was one of those persons who wore Ihram for an ‘Umrah. But on my way (to Makkah) I menstruated. The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) entered upon me while I was weeping. He asked why are you weeping? I wished I would not come out (for Hajj) this year. He said give up your `Umrah; untie your hair and comb. The version of Musa said and raise your voice in talbiyah for Hajj (after wearing Ihram). Sulaiman’s version goes and do as all the Muslims do during their Hajj. When the night for performing the obligatory circumambulation (tawaf al-Ziyarah) came, the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) commanded `Abd al-Rahman. He took her to al-Tan’im (instead of the words “her ‘Umrah”). She went round the Ka’bah. Allah thus completed both her ‘Umrah and Hajj. Hisham said : No sacrificial animal was offered during all this time. In the version of Hammad bin Salamah, the narrator Musa added when the night of al-Batha came Ai’ shah was purified",
