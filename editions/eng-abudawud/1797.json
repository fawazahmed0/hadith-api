			"text": "Narrated Al-Bara' ibn Azib: I was with Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) appointed him to be the governor of the Yemen. I collected some ounces of gold during my stay with him. When Ali returned from the Yemen to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) he said: I found that Fatimah had put on coloured clothes and the smell of the perfume she had used was pervading the house. (He expressed his amazement at the use of coloured clothes and perfume.) She said: What is wrong with you? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has ordered his companions to put off their ihram and they did so. Ali said: I said to her: I raised my voice in talbiyah for which the Prophet (ﷺ) raised his voice (i.e. I wore ihram for qiran). Then I came to the Prophet (ﷺ). He asked (me): How did you do? I replied: I raised my voice in talbiyah, for which the Prophet (ﷺ) raised his voice. He said: I have brought the sacrificial animals with me and combined umrah and hajj. He said to me: Sacrifice sixty-seven or sixty-six camels (for me) and withhold for yourself thirty-three or thirty-four, and withhold a piece (of flesh) for me from every camel",
