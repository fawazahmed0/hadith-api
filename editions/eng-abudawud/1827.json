But afterwards they can wear any kind of clothing they like dyed yellow or silk or jewelry or trousers or shirts or shoes. Abu Dawud said ‘Abdah and Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated this tradition from Muhammad bin Ishaq up to the words “And to wear clothes with dye of waras or saffron on them”. They did not mention the words after them",
