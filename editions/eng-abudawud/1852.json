			"text": "Abu Qatadah said that he accompanied the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and he stayed behind on the way to Makkah with some of his companions who were wearing ihram, although he was not. When he saw a wild ass he mounted his horse and asked them to hand him his whip, but they refused. He then asked them to hand him his lance. When they refused, he took it, chased the while ass and killed it. Some of the Companions of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) ate it and some refused (to eat). When they met the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) they asked him about it. He said that was the food that Allaah provided you for eating",
