Thereupon the disbelievers said “The people whom the fever has weakened and who suffer misery at Medina are coming to you.” Allaah, the exalted, informed the Prophet (ﷺ) of what they had said. He, therefore, ordered them to perform ramal (walk proudly with swift pace) in first three circuits and walk ordinarily between the two corners (Yamani Corner and the Black Stone). When they saw them the believers walking proudly, they said” These are the people about whom you mentioned that the fever had weakened them, but they are more vigorous than us.” Ibn ‘Abbas said “He did not order them to walk proudly in all circuits (of the circumambulation) out of mercy upon them.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari And Sahih Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":11,"hadith":166}}]}
