			"text": "Abu Hurairah said “When Allah, the Exalted, granted the conquest of Makkah to his Apostle, the Prophet(ﷺ) stood among them(the people) and praised Allaah and extolled Him. He then said, Verily Allaah stopped the Elephant from Makkah, and gave His Apostle and the believers sway upon it and it has been made lawful for me only for one hour on one day then it will remain sacred till the Day of Resurrection. Its trees are not to be cut, its game is not to be molested and the things dropped there are to be picked up only by one who publicly announces it. ‘Abbas or Al ‘Abbas suggested “Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) except the rush(idhkir) for it is useful for our graves and our houses. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “Except the rush.” Abu Dawud said “Ibn Al Musaffa added on the authority of Al Walid Abu Shah a man from the people of the Yemen stood and said “Give me in writing, Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ)”. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “Give in writing to Abu Shah. I said to Al Awza’i “What does the statement mean? Give Abu Shah in writing?” He said “This was an address which he heard from the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ).”",
