He reported the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) as saying “ Madeenah is sacred from A’ir to Thawr so if anyone produces an innovation (in it) or gives protection to an innovator the curse of Allaah, angels and all men will fall upon him and no repentance or ransom will be accepted from him. The protection granted by Muslim is one (even if) the humblest of them grants it. So if anyone breaks a covenant made by a Muslim the curse of Allaah, angels and all men will fall upon him and no repentance or ransom will be accepted from him. If anyone attributes his manumission to people without the permission of his masters the curse of Allaah, angels and all men will fall upon him and no repentance or ransom will be accepted from him",
