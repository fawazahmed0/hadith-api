He took away his clothes from him. His patrons came to him and spoke to him about it, but he replied: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) declared this territory to be sacred, saying: If anyone catches someone hunting in it he should take away from him his clothes. So I shall not return to you a provision which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has given me, but if you wish I shall pay you its price",
