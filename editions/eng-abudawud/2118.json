			"text": "Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) taught us the address in case of some need: Praise be to Allah from Whom we ask help and pardon, and in Whom we take refuge from the evils within ourselves. He whom Allah guides has no one who can lead him astray, and he whom He leads astray has no one to guide him. I testify that there is no god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and Apostle. \"You who believe,...fear Allah by Whom you ask your mutual rights, and reverence the wombs. Allah has been watching you.\" ...\"you who believe, fear Allah as He should be feared, and die only as Muslims\" ....\"you who believe, fear Allah as He should be feared, and die only as Muslims\".....\"you who believe, fear Allah and say what is true. He will make your deeds sound, and forgive your sins. He who obeys Allah and His Apostle has achieved a mighty success.\" The narrator, Muhammad ibn Sulayman, did mention the word \"inna\" (verily)",
