The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out one morning and found Habibah by his door. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Who is this? She replied: I am Habibah, daughter of Sahl. He asked: What is your case? She replied: I and Thabit ibn Qays, referring to her husband, cannot live together. When Thabit ibn Qays came, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: This is Habibah, daughter of Sahl, and she has mentioned (about you) what Allah wished to mention. Habibah said: Messenger of Allah, all that he gave me is with me. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to Thabit ibn Qays: Take it from her. So he took it from her, and she lived among her people (relatives)",
