Should he kill him and then be killed by you, or how should he act? Ask the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) ‘Asim, for me about it. ‘Asim then asked the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) about it. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) disliked the question and denounced it. What ‘Asim heard from the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) fell heavy on him. When ‘Asim returned to his family ‘Uwaimr came to him and asked ‘Asim “What did the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) say to you”? Asim replied “You did not do good to me”. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) disliked the question that I asked him. Thereupon ‘Uwaimir said “I swear by Allaah, I shall not leave until I ask him about it. So, ‘Uwaimir came to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) while he was sitting in the midst of the people.” He said “Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) tell me about a man who finds a man along with his wife. Should he kill him and then be killed by you, or how should he act?” The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “A revelation has been sent down about you and your wife so go away and bring her. Sahl said “So we cursed one another while I was along with the people who were with the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). Then when they finished, ‘Umamir said “I shall have lied against her, Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) if I keep her. He pronounced her divorce three times before the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ)commanded him (to do so). Ibn Shihab said “Then this became the method of invoking curses.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari And Sahih Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":13,"hadith":71}}]}
