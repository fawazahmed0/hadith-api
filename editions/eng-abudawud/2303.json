The tradition narrated by Yazid bin Harun from Hisham does perfectly correspond to the tradition transmitted by Ibrahim bin Tahman and ‘Abd Allah Al Shami from Hisham. The narrator Al Misma’I reported Yazid as saying “I do not know but that he said “she should not dye herself.” To this the narrator Harun added “She should not wear colored clothes except one of the types made of dyed yarn.”",
