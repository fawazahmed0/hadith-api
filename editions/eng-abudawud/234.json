			"text": "This tradition has been reported by Hammad b. Salamah through the same chain of narrators and conveying a similar meaning. This version adds in the beginning:He uttered TAKBIR (Allahu akbar), and in the end : when he finished the prayer, he said : I am a human being; I was sexually defiled. Abu Dawud said : This tradition has been narrated al-Zuhri from Abu Salamah b. ‘Abd al-Rahman on the authority of Abu Hurairah. It says: When he stood at the place of prayer, we waited for his utterance of takbir (Allah-u akbar).He went away and said : (remain) as you were. Another version on the authority of Muhammad reporting from the Prophet (ﷺ) says: He uttered takbir (Allah-u-Akbar) and then made a sign to the people, meaning \"sit down\". He then went away and took a bath. This tradition has also been narrated through a different chain. It says: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) uttered takbir (Allah-u-akbar) in a prayer. Abu Dawud said: Another version through a different chain says; The Prophet (May peace be upon him) uttered takbir (Allah-u akbar)",
