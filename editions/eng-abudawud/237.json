Allah is not ashamed of truth what do you think, if a woman sees what a man sees in dream, should she take a bath or not? The prophet (ﷺ) replied: Yes, she should take a bath if she finds the liquid (vaginal secretion) ‘A’ishah said : Then I came upon her and said her : Woe to you! Does a woman see that (sexual dream)? In the meantime, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came upon me and said: May your right hand be covered with dust! How can there be the resemblance (i.e., between the child and the mother)? Abu Dawud said: A similar version has been narrated by Zubaid, ‘Uqail, Yunus, cousin of Al-Zuhri, Ibn Abi-Wazir, on the authority of al-Zuhr, musan, al-Hajabi, like al-Zuhri, narrated on the authority of ‘Urwah from ‘A’ishah, but Hisham b. ‘Urwah narrated from ‘Urwah on the authority of Zainab daughter of Abu Salamah from Umm Salamah saying. Umm Sulaim came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)",
