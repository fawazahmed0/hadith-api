Once he forgot how many times he had poured (water). Therefore he asked me: how many times did I pour (water)? I do not know. He said : may you miss your mother! What prevented you from remembering it? He then performed ablution as he did for prayer and poured water over his skin (body). He then said: this is how the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) purified (himself)",
