			"text": "Narrated Ubaydullah ibn Khalid as-Sulami: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made a brotherhood between two men, one of whom was killed (in Allah's path), and a week or thereabouts later the other died, and we prayed at his funeral). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked: What did you say? We replied: We prayed for him and said: O Allah, forgive him, and join him to his companion. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: What about his prayers since the time the other died, and his fasting since the time the other died--the narrator Shu'bah doubted the words, \"his fasting--and his deeds since the time the other died. The distance between them is just like the distance between heaven and earth",
