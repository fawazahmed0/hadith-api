Then its master came, he beat me and took my garment. He came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who said to him: You did not teach him if he was ignorant; and you did not feed him if he was hungry. He ordered him, so he returned my garment to me, and gave me one or half a wasq (sixty or thirty sa's) of corn",
