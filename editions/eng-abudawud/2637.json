Abu Dawud said: Only Ma'mar has transmitted this tradition. By this he refers to his statement \"War is deception\" through this chain of narrators. He narrated it from the tradition of 'Amr b. Dinar from Jabir, and from the tradition of Ma'mar from Hammam b. Munabbih on the authority of Abu Hurairah",
