So I began to announce loudly in Medina: Is there anyone who takes a man on his ride, and he will get his share (from the booty? An old man from the Ansar (Helpers) spoke loudly: We shall have his share if we take him with us on our mount by turns, and he will have his meal with us. I said: Yes. He said: So go on journey with Allah's blessing. I then proceeded along with my best companion and Allah gave us booty. Some she-camels were given to me as my share of booty. I drove them till I reached him. He came out and sat on the rear part of the saddle of his camel. He then said: Drive them backward. He again said: Drive them forward. He then said: I find your she-camels very gentle. He said: This is your booty which I stipulated for you. He replied: Take your she-camels, my nephew; we did not intend (to get) your portion","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":200}}]}
