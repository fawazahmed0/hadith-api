			"text": "Salamah (bin Al ‘Akwa) said “Abd Al rahman bin ‘Uyainah raided the Camels of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and killed their herdsman. He and some people who were with him on horses proceeded on driving them away. I turned my face towards Madeenah and shouted three times. A morning raid, I then went after the people shooting arrows at them and hamstringing them (their beasts). When a horseman returned to me, I sat in the foot of a tree till there was no riding beast of the Prophet (ﷺ) created by Allaah which I had not kept behind my back. They threw away more than thirty lance and thirty cloaks to lighten themselves. Then ‘Uyainah came to them with reinforcement and said “A few of you should go to him. Four of them stood and came to me. They ascended a mountain. Then they came near me till they could hear my voice. I told them “Do you know me?” They said “Who are you? I replied “I am Ibn Al ‘Akwa. By Him Who honored the face of Muhammad (ﷺ) if any man of you pursues he cannot catch me and if I pursue him, I will not miss him. This went on with me till I saw the horsemen of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) coming through the trees. Al Akhram Al Asadi was at their head. He then joined ‘Abd Al Rahman bin ‘Uyainah and ‘Abd Al Rahman turned over him. They attacked each other with lances. Al Akhram hamstrung ‘Abd Al Rahman’s horse and ‘Abd Al Rahman pierced a lance in his body and killed him. ‘Abd al Rahman then returned on the horse of Al Akhram. I then came to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) who was present at the same water from where I drove them away and which is known as Dhu Qarad. The Prophet (ﷺ) was among five hundred people. He then gave me two portions a horseman’s and a footman’s",
