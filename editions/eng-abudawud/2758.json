The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) replied: I do not break a covenant or imprison messengers, but return, and if you feel the same as you do just now, come back. So I went away, and then came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and accepted Islam. The narrator Bukair said: He informed me that Abu Rafi' was a Copt. Abu Dawud said: This was valid in those days, but today it is not valid",
