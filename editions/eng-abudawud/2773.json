The narrator Ibn Al Sarh then narrated the rest of the tradition. He said “The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) forbade the Muslims to speak to any three of us. When considerable time had passed on me, I ascended the wall of Abu Qatadah who was my cousin. I saluted him, but, I swear by Allaah he did not return my salutation. I then offered the dawn prayer on the fiftieth day on the roof of one of our houses. I then hear d a crier say “Ka’ab bin Mailk, have good news”. When the man whose voice I heard came to me giving me good news, I took off my garments and clothed him. I went on till I entered the mosque. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) was sitting there. Talhah bin ‘Ubaid Allaah stood up and hastened to me till he shook hands with me and greeted me",
