			"text": "Narrated Sa'd ibn AbuWaqqas: We went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) from Mecca making for Medina. When we were near Azwara', he alighted, then raised his hands, and made supplication to Allah for a time, after which he prostrated himself, remaining a long time in prostration. Then he stood up and raised his hands for a time, after which he prostrated himself, remaining a long time in prostration. He then stood up and raised his hands for a time, after which he prostrated himself. Ahmad mentioned it three times. He then said: I begged my Lord and made intercession for my people, and He gave me a third of my people, so I prostrated myself in gratitude to my Lord. Then I raised my head and begged my Lord for my people, and He gave me a third of my people, so I prostrated myself in gratitude to my Lord. Then I raised my head and begged my Lord for my people and He gave me the remaining third, so I prostrated myself in gratitude to my Lord. Abu Dawud said: When Ahmad b. Salih narrated this tradition to us, he omitted the name of Ash'ath b. Ishaq, but Musa b. Sahl al-Ramli narrated it to us through him",
