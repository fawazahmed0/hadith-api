			"text": "Aishah reported :Umm Habibah asked the prophet (ﷺ) about the blood (which flows beyond the period of menstruation). ‘A’ishah said: I saw her wash-tub full of blood. The apostle of Allah (May peace be upon him) said; Keep away (from prayer) equal (to the length of time) that your menses prevented you. Then wash yourself. Abu Dawud said: Qutaibah mentioned the name Jaftar b. Rabi’ah in the middle of the text of the tradition for the second time (i.e., Qutaibah, being doubtful about the narrator Jafar b. Rabi’ah, mentioned his name twice: once in the chain and again while reporting the text). Ali b. ‘Ayyash and yunus b. Muhammad reported it on the authority of al-Laith. They mentioned the name Jafar b. Rabi’ah",
