He said: If anyone prays like our prayer, and sacrifices like our sacrifice, his sacrifice is all right. If anyone sacrifices before the prayer (for 'Id), that is goat meant for flesh. Abu Burdah b. Niyar stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, I swear by Allah, I sacrificed before I went for prayer. I thought it was the day of eating and drinking; so I made haste, and ate myself, and supplied flesh to my family and neighbors. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: That is a goat meant for eating flesh. He said: I have a kid (of less than a year) which is better than two goats meant for flesh. Will it be valid from me ? He said: Yes, but it will not be valid for anyone after you","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari And Sahih Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":16,"hadith":13}}]}
