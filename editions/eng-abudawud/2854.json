He said: If it strikes with its end, eat, and if it strikes with the middle part of it, do not eat, for it died by a violent blow. I said: I set off my dog? He replies: If you mention Allah's name, eat, otherwise do not eat. If it eats any of it, do not eat, for it caught for itself. He asked: I set off my dog, and I find with it another dog ? He replied: Do not eat, because you mentioned Allah's name on your dog",
