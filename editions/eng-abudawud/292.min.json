He reported it from 'Aishah through a different chain of narrators. 'Aishah said: Zainab daughter of Jahsh had a prolonged flow of blood. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to her: Take bath for every prayer. The narrator then reported the tradition (in full). Abu Dawud said: The version transmitted by 'Abd al-Samad from Sulaiman b.
