She was an orphan in the guardianship of Abu Bakr. I read the Qur'anic verse \"To those also to whom your right hand was pledged.\" She said: Do not read the verse; \"To those also to whom your right hand was pledged.\" This was revealed about Abu Bakr and his son 'Abd al-Rahman when he refused to accept Islam. Abu Bakr took an oath that he would not give him a share from inheritance. When he embraced Islam Allah Most High commanded His Prophet (ﷺ) to give him the share. The narrator 'Abd al-Aziz added: He did not accept Islam until he was urged on Islam by sword. Abu Dawud said: He who narrated the word 'aqadat means a pact ; and he who narrated the word 'aaqadat means the party who made a pact. The correct is the tradition of Talhah ('aaqadat)","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":19,"hadith":39}}]}
