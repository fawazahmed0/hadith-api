When he reached as-Suwaida', a man suddenly came searching for medicine and ammonium anthorhizum extract, and he said: A man who heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) addressing the people commanding and prohibiting them, told me that he said: O people, accept presents so long as they remain presents; but when the Quraysh quarrel about the rule, and the presents are given for the religion of one of you, then leave them alone. Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by Ibn al-Mubarak from Muhammad b. Yasar from Sulaim b. Mutair",
