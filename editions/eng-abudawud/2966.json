What Allah as bestowed on His Apostle (and taken away) from the people of the townships - belong to Allah - to the Apostle, and to kindred and orphans, the needy and the wayfarer, to the indigent emigrants, those who were expelled from their homes and their property, and to those who, before them, had homes (in Medina), and had adopted the faith, and to those who came after them. This verse completely covered all the people ; they remained no one from Muslims but he had his right in it, or share (according to Ayyub's version) except the slaves",
