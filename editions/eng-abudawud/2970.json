I fear if I depart a little from his practice, I shall diverge (from the right path). As regards his sadaqah (property) at Medina, 'Umar had given it to 'Ali ad 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them), and 'Ali dominated it. As for Khaibar and Fadak, 'Umar retained them. He said: They were the sadaqah (property) of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), exclusively reserved for his purposes that happened, and for his emergent needs. Their management was assigned to the one who was in authority. He said: They are in that condition to the present day",
