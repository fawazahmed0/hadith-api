I said: Messenger of Allah, you have divided (the fifth) among our brethren Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib, but you have not given us anything, though our relationship to you is the same as theirs. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The Banu Hisham and the Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib are one. Jubair said: He did not divide the fifth among the Banu 'Abd Shams and the Banu Nawfal as he divided among the Banu Hashim and the Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib. He said: Abu Bakr used to divide the fifth like the division of Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) except that he did not give the relatives of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), as he gave them. 'Umar b. al-Khattab and 'Uthman after him used to give them (a portion) from it",
