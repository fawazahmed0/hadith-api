The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) also gave me an old she camel from the fifth that day. When I intended to cohabit with Fathimah daughter of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), I made arrangement with a man who was a goldsmith belonging to Banu Qainuqa’ to go with me so that we may bring grass. I intended to sell it to the goldsmith there by seeking help in my wedding feast. While I was collecting for my old Camels saddles, baskets and ropes both of she Camels were seated in a corner of the apartment of a man of the Ansar. When I collected what I collected (i.e., equipment) I turned (towards them). I suddenly found that the humps of she Camels were cut off and their hips were pierced and their lives were taken out. I could not control my eyes (to weep) when I saw that scene. I said “Who has done this?” They (the people) replied “Hamzah bin ‘Abd Al Muttalib”. He is among the drunkards of the Ansar in this house. A singing girl is singing for him and his Companions. While singing she said “Oh Hamza, rise to these plumpy old she Camels. So he jumped to the sword and cut off their humps, pierced their hips and took out their livers.” ‘Ali said “I went till I entered upon the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) while Zaid bin Harithah was with him.” The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) realized what I had met with. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) aid “What is the matter with you?” I said Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), I never saw the thing that happened with me today. Hamzah wronged my she Camels, he cut off their humps, pierced their hips. Lo! He is in a house with drunkards. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) asked for his cloak. It was brought to him. He then went out, I and Zaid bin Harithah followed him until we reached the house where Hamzah was. He asked permission ( to entre). He was permitted. He found drunkards there. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) began to rebuke him (Hamzah) for his action. Hamzah was intoxicated and his eyes were reddish. Hamzah looked at the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). He then raised his eyes and looked at his knees, he then raised his eyes and looked at his navel and he then raised his eyes and looked at his face. Hamzah then said “Are you but the salves of my father? Then the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) knew that he was intoxicated. So the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) moved backward. He then went out and we also went out with him.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari And Sahih Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":20,"hadith":59}}]}
