We said: Give us this piece of skin in your hand. He then gave it to us and we read it. It contained the text: \"From Muhammad, Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), to Banu Zuhayr ibn Uqaysh. If you bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, offer prayer, pay zakat, pay the fifth from the booty, and the portion of the Prophet (ﷺ) and his special portion (safi), you will be under by the protection of Allah and His Apostle.\" We then asked: Who wrote this document for you? He replied: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)",
