			"text": "Ibn ‘Abbas said “When the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) had victory over Quraish in the batte of Badr and came to Madeenah he gathered the Jews in the market of Banu Qainuqa and said “O community of Jews embrace Islam before you suffer an injury as the Quraish suffered.” They said “Muhammad, you should not deceive yourself (taking pride) that you had killed a few persons of the Quariash who were inexperienced and did not know how to fight. Had you fought with us, you would have known us. You have never met people like us.” Allah Most High revealed about this the following verse “Say to those who reject faith, soon will ye be vanished... one army was fighting in the cause of Allaah, the other resisting Allaah.”",
