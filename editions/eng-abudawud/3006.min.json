So they concluded a treaty of peace providing that gold, silver and weapons would go to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and whatever they took away on their camels would belong to them, on condition that they would not hide and carry away anything. If they did (so), there would be no protection for them and no treaty (with Muslims). They carried away a purse of Huyayy ibn Akhtab who was killed before (the battle of) Khaybar. He took away the ornaments of Banu an-Nadir when they were expelled. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked Sa'yah: Where is the purse of Huyayy ibn Akhtab? He replied: The contents of this purse were spent on battles and other expenses. (Later on) they found the purse. So he killed Ibn AbulHuqayq, captured their women and children, and intended to deport them. They said: Muhammad, leave us to work on this land; we shall have half (of the produce) as you wish, and you will have half. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to make a contribution of eighty wasqs of dates and twenty wasqs of wheat to each of his wives","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Isnaad"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Hasan Isnaad"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":20,"hadith":79}}]}
