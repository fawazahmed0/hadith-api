He replied:She should wash at the time of the Zuhr prayer (the bath will be valid one Zuhr prayer to the next Zuhr prayer); and should perform ablution for every prayer. If there is excessive bleed gin, she should tie a cloth over her private part. Abu Dawud said: It has been narrated by Ibn 'Umar and Anas b. Malik that she should take bath at the time of the Zuhr prayer (being valid) until the next Zuhr prayer. This tradition has also been transmuted by Dawud and 'Asim from al-Sha'bi from his wife from Qumair on the authority of 'Aishah, except that the version of Dawud has the words: \"every day,\" and the version of 'Asim has the words: \"at the time of Zuhr prayer\". This is the view of Salim b. 'Abd Allah, al-Hassan, and 'Ata. Abu Dawud said: Malik said: I think that the tradition narrated by Ibn a;-Musayyab must contain the words: \"from one purification to another\". But it was misunderstood and the people changed it to: \"for one Zuhr prayer to another\". It has also been reported by Miswar b. 'Abd al-Malik b. Sa'id b. 'Abd al-Rahman b. Yarbu', saying: \"from one purification to another,\" but the people changed it to: \"from one zuhr to another",
