He did not give him (the land which involved) the right of a Muslim. The Prophet (ﷺ) wrote a document for him. It goes: \"In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful. This is what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) assigned to Bilal ibn Harith al-Muzani. He gave him the mines of al-Qabaliyyah, both which lay on the upper side and which lay on the lower side, and (the land) which is suitable for cultivation at Quds. He did not give him the right of any Muslim.\" Abu Uwais said: A similar tradition has been narrated to me by Thawr b. Zaid, client of Banu al-Dail b. Bakr b. Kinahah from 'Ikrimah on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas",
