She replied: Allah's words: \"If anyone does evil, he will be requited for it.\" He said: Do you know A'ishah, that when a believer is afflicted with a calamity or a thorn, it serves as an atonement for his evil deed. He who is called to account will be punished. She said: Does Allah not say: \"He truly will recieve an easy reckoning.\" He said: This is the presentation, A'ishah. If anyone criticized in reckoning, he will be punished. Abu Dawud said: This is the version of Ibn Bashshar. He said: Ibn Abi Mulaikah narrated to us",
