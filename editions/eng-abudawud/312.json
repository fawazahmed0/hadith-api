Jundub commands women to complete the prayers abandoned during their menstrual period. She said: They should not do so. The wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) would refrain (from prayer) for forty nights (i.e. days) during the course of bleeding after child birth. The Prophet (ﷺ) would not command them to complete the prayers abandoned during the period of bleeding. Muhammad b. Hatim said: The name of Al-Azdiyyah is Mussah and her patronymic name is Umm Busrah. Abu Dawud said: The patronymic names of Kathir b. Ziyad s Abu Sahl",
