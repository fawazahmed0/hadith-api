If he (the dead person) was good, send him to it quickly; if he was otherwise, keep away the people of Hell. The bier should be followed and should not follow. Those who go in front of it are not accompanying it. Abu Dawud said: The narrator Yahya b. 'Abd Allah is weak. He is Yahya al-Jabir Abu Dawud said: This is from Kufah, and Abu Majidah is from Basrah. Abu Dawud said: Abu Majidah is obscure",
