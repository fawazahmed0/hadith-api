Her necklace of onyx of Zifar was broken (and fell somewhere). The people were detained to make a search for that necklace until the dawn broke. There was no water with the people. Therefore AbuBakr became angry with her and said: You detained the people and they have no water with them. Thereupon Allah, the Exalted, sent down revelation about it to His Apostle (ﷺ) granting concession to purify themselves with pure earth. Then the Muslims stood up with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and struck the ground with their hands and then they raised their hands, and did not take any earth (in their hands). Then they wiped with them their faces and hands up to the shoulders, and from their palms up to the armpits. Ibn Yahya added in his version: Ibn Shihab said in his tradition: The people do not take this (tradition) into account. Abu Dawud said: Ibn Ishaq also reported it in a similar way. In this (version) he said on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas. He mentioned the words \"two strikes\" (i.e. striking the earth twice) as mentioned by Yunus. And Ma'mar also narrated on the authority of al-Zuhri \"two strikes\". And Malik said: From al-Zuhri from 'Ubaid Allah b. 'Abd Allah from his father on the authority of 'Ammar. Abu Uwais also reported it in a similar way on the authority of al-Zuhri. But Ibn 'Uyainah doubted it, he sometimes said: from his father, and sometimes he said: from Ibn 'Abbas. Ibn 'Uyainah was confused in it and in his hearing from al-Zuhri. No one has mentioned \"two strikes\" in this tradition except those whose names I have mentioned","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":320}}]}
