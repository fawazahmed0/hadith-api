He then said: Shroud him in his two garments, was him with water and lotus leaves, but do not cover his head, for he will be raised on the Day of Resurrection saying the talbiyah. Abu Dawud said: I heard Ahmad b. Hanbal say: There are five rules of the law (sunan) in this tradition: \"Shroud him in his two garment,\" that is, the dead should be shrouded in his two garments. \"Wash him with water and lotus leaves,\" that is, washing all times should be with lotus leaves. Do not bring any perfume near him. The shroud will be made from the property (of the dead)",
