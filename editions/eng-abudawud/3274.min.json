If anyone takes an oath and then considers something else better than it, he should give it up, and do what is better, for leaving it is its atonement. Abu Dawud said: All sound traditions from the Prophet (ﷺ) say: \"He should make atonement for his oath,\" except those versions which are not reliable. Abu Dawud said: I said to Ahmad: Yahya b. Sa'id (al-Qattan) has transmitted this tradition from Yahya b. 'Ubaid Allah. He (Ahmad b. Hanbal) said: But he gave it up after that, and he was competent for doing it. Ahmad said: His (Yahya b.
