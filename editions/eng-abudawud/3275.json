So he asked the defendant to swear. He swore by Allah \"There is no god but He.\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Yes, you have done it, but you have been forgiven for the sincerity of the statement: \"There is no god but Allah.\" Abu Dawud said: This tradition means that he did not command him to make atonement",
