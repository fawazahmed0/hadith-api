So he came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: I have taken a vow to sacrifice a camel at Buwanah. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked: Did the place contain any idol worshipped in pre-Islamic times? They (the people) said: No. He asked: Was any pre-Islamic festival observed there? They replied: No. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Fulfil your vow, for a vow to do an act of disobedience to Allah must not be fulfilled, neither must one do something over which a human being has no control",
