			"text": "Narrated Maymunah, daughter of Kardam: I went out with my father to see the hajj performed by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I fixed my eyes on him. My father came near him while he was riding his she-camel. He had a whip like the whip of scribes. I heard the bedouin and the people say: The whip, the whip. My father came near him and held his foot. She said: He admitted his Prophethood and stood and listened to him. He said: Messenger of Allah, I have made a vow that if a son is born to me, I shall slaughter a number of sheep at the end of Buwanah in the dale of hill. The narrator said: I do not know (for certain) that she said: Fifty (sheep). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Does it contain any idol? He said: No. Then he said: Fulfil your vow that you have taken for Allah. He then gathered them (i.e. the sheep) and began to slaughter them. A sheep ran away from them. He searched for it saying: O Allah, fulfil my vow on my behalf. So he succeeded (in finding it) and slaughtered it",
