			"text": "Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would not say funeral prayer over a person who died while the debt was due from him. A dead Muslim was brought to him and he asked: Is there any debt due from him? They (the people) said: Yes, two dirhams. He said: Pray yourselves over your companion. Then AbuQatadah al-Ansari said: I shall pay them, Messenger of Allah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then prayed over him. When Allah granted conquests to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he said: I am nearer to every believer than himself, so if anyone (dies and) leaves a debt, I shall be responsible for paying it; and if anyone leaves property, it goes to his heirs",
