			"text": "Yunus said:I asked Abu Zinad about the sale of fruits before they were clearly in good condition, and what was said about it. He replied: Urwah ibn az-Zubayr reports a tradition from Sahl ibn Abi Hathmah on the authority of Zayd ibn Thabit who said: The people used to sell fruits before they were clearly in good condition. When the people cut off the fruits, and were demanded to pay the price, the buyer said: The fruits have been smitten by duman, qusham and murad fruit diseases on which they used to dispute. When their disputes which were brought to the Prophet (ﷺ) increased, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to them as an advice: No, do not sell fruits till they are in good condition, due to a large number of their disputes and differences",
