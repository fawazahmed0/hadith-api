The man had his family with him. Samurah used to visit his palm-trees, and the man was annoyed by that and felt it keenly. So he asked him (Samurah) to sell them to him, but he refused. He then asked him to take something else in exchange, but he refused. So he came to the Holy Prophet (ﷺ) and mentioned it to him. The Holy Prophet (ﷺ) asked him to sell it to him, but he refused. He asked him to take something else in exchange, but he refused. He then said:Give it to him and you can have such and such, mentioning something with which he tried to please him, but he refused. He then said: You are a nuisance. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said to the Ansari: Go and uproot his palm-trees","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":25,"hadith":66}}]}
