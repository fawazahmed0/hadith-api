Some of them were sitting together because of lack of clothing while a reader was reciting to us. All of a sudden the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came along and stood beside us. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood, the reader stopped and greeted him. He asked: What were you doing? We said: Messenger of Allah! We had a reader who was reciting to us and we were listening to the Book of Allah, the Exalted. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: Praise be to Allah Who has put among my people those with whom I have been ordered to stay. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then sat among us so as to be like one of us, and when he had made a sign with his hand they sat in a circle with their faces turned towards him. The narrator said: I think that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not recognize any of them except me. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: Rejoice, you group of poor emigrants, in the announcement that you will have perfect light on the Day of Resurrection. You will enter Paradise half a day before the rich, and that is five hundred years","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":26,"hadith":26}}]}
