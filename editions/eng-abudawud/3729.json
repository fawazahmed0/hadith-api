He then brought a drink which he drank and he gave it to the one on his right. He ate dried dates and began to put the kernels on the back of his ring finger and middle finger. When he got up, my father also got up, and held the rein of his mount. He said : Pray to Allah for me. He said : O Allah, bless them in what you provided them, and have mercy on them",
