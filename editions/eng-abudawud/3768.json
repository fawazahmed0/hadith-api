When he raised it to his mouth, he said: In the name of Allah at the beginning and at the end of it. The Prophet (ﷺ) laughed and said: The devil kept eating along with him, but when he mentioned Allah's name, he vomited what was in his belly. Abu Dawud: Jabir bin Subh is grandfather of Sulaiman bin Harb from his mother's side",
