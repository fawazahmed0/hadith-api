He then said: O Allah, have mercy on me and on Muhammad and do not have mercy on anyone along with us. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: You have narrowed down (a thing) that was broader. After a short while he passed a water in the corner of the mosque. The people rushed towards him. The Prophet (ﷺ) prevented them and said: You have been sent to facilitate and not create difficulties. Pour a bucket of water upon it",
