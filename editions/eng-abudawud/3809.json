			"text": "Narrated Ghalib ibn Abjar: We faced a famine, and I had nothing from my property which I could feed my family ex except a few asses, and the Prophet (ﷺ) forbade the flesh of domestic asses. So I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon) , we are suffering from famine, and I have no property which I feed my family except some fat asses, and you have forbidden the flesh of domestic asses. He said: Feed your family on the fat asses of yours, for I forbade them on account of the animal which feeds on the filth of the town, that is, the animal which feeds on filth. Abu Dawud said: This 'Abd al-Rahman is Ibn Ma'qil. Abu Dawud said: Suh'bah transmitted this tradition from 'Ubaid Abi al-Hasan, from 'Abd al-Rahman bin Maq'il, from'Abd al-Rahman bin Bishr, from some people of Muzainah stating that Abjar, the chief of Muzainah, or Ibn Abjar asked the Prophet (ﷺ)",
