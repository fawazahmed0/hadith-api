He then came back from him and passed some people who had a lunatic fettered in chains. His people said: We are told that your companion has brought some good. Have you something with which you can cure him? I then recited Surat al-Fatihah and he was cured. They gave me one hundred sheep. I then came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and informed him of it. He asked: Is it only this? The narrator, Musaddad, said in his other version: Did you say anything other than this?
