They said: We have been told that you have brought what is good from this man. Have you any medicine or a charm, for we have a lunatic in chains? We said: Yes. Then they brought a lunatic in chains. He said: I recited Surat al-Fatihah over him for three days, morning and evening. Whenever I finished it, I would collect my saliva and spit it out, and he seemed as if he were set free from a bond. He said: They gave me some payment, but I said: No, not until I ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He (the Prophet) said: Accept it, for, by my life, some accept it for a worthless charm, but you have done so for a genuine one","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":29,"hadith":47}}]}
