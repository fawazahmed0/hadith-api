			"text": "It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:\"An omen is in a dwelling, a woman or a horse.\" Abu Dawud said: This tradition was read out to al-Harith b. Miskin and I was witness. It was said to him that Ibn Qasim told him that Malik was asked about evil omen in a horse and in a house. He replied: There are many houses in which people lived and perished and again others lived therein and they also perished. This is its explanation so far as we know. Allah knows best. Abu Dawud said: 'Umar (ra) said: A mat in a house better than a woman who does not give birth to a child",
