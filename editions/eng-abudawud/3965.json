The narrator, Mutadh, said: I heard my father (sometimes) say: \"Palace of at-Ta'if,\" and (sometimes) \"Fort of at-Ta'if,\" which are the same. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: he who causes an arrow to hit its mark in Allah's cause will have it counted as a degree for him (in Paradise). He then transmitted the rest of the tradition. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: If a Muslim man emancipates a Muslim man, Allah, the Exalted, will make every bone of his protection for every bone of his emancipator from Hell; and if a Muslim woman emancipates a Muslim woman, Allah will make every bone of hers protection for every bone of her emancipator from Hell on the Day of Resurrection",
