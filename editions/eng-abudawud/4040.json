He said: Messenger of Allah, would that you purchased it and wore it on Friday and when a delegation came to you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Only he who has no portion in the next world wears this (silk). Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came in possession of some robes made of silk and gave one of them to 'Umar b. al-Khattab. 'Umar said: Messenger of Allah, you are clothing me with it, but you said about the robe of 'Utarid what you said. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I did not give it to you so that you may wear it. So 'Umar al-Khattab gave it to his brother who was a polytheist in Mecca to wear it",
