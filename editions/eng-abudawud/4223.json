So he threw it away, and came wearing an iron signet ring. He (the Prophet) said: What is it that I see you wearing the adornment of the inhabitants of Hell? So he threw it away. He asked: Messenger of Allah, what material I must use? He said: Make it of silver, but do not weigh it as much as a mithqal, The narrator Muhammad did not say: \" 'Abd Allah b. Muslim,\" and al-Hasan did not say: \"al-Sulami al-Marwazi",
