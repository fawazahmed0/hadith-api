When ‘Umar came to power, he called upon people and said to them: The people are living now near watering placing, and, according to Musaddad’s version, “near villages and watering places, so what do you say about the punishment for (drinking) wine? ‘Abd al-Rahman b. ‘Awf said: We think that you should prescribe the lightest punishment. So he fixed eight lashes for it. Abu Dawud said: It has also been transmitted by Ibn Al 'Arubah from Qatadah from the Prophet (ﷺ) to the effect that he gave a beating forty times with palm branches and sandals. And Shu'bah narrated it from Qatadah on the authority of Anas from Prophet (ﷺ). This version has: He gave a beating with two palm-branches about forty times",
