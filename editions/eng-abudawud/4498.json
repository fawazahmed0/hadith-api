The slayer said: Messenger of Allah, I swear by Allah, I did not intend to kill him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to the legal guardian: Now if he is true and you kill him, you will enter Hell-fire. So he let him go. His hands were tied with a strap. He came out pulling his strap. Hence he was called Dhu an-Nis'ah (possessor of strap)",
