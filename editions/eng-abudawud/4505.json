A man of the Yemen called Abu Shah stood up and said: Write for me, Messenger of Allah. The narrator al-'Abbas (b. al-Walid) said: Write to me, (you people). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Write (you people), for Abu Shah. These are the wordings of the tradition of Ahmad. Abu Dawud said: Write (you people), for me, that is, the address of the Prophet (ﷺ)",
