The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Bring the man to me. The man was called, but people could not get control over him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: Go away, you are free. He asked: Messenger of Allah! upon whom does my help lie? He replied: On every believer, or he said: On every Muslim. Abu Dawud said: The name of the man who was emancipated was Rawh b. Dinar Abu Dawud said: The man who cut off the penis was Zinba' Abu Dawud said: The Zinba' Abu Rawh was master of the slave",
