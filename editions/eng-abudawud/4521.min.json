Abi Hathmah and some senior men of the tribe told that 'Abd Allah b. Abi Sahl and Muhayyasah came to Khaibar on account of the calamity (i.e. famine) that befall them. Muhayyasah came and told the 'Abd Allah b. Sahl had been killed and thrown in a well or stream. He hen came to the Jews and said:I swear by Allah, you have killed him. They said: We swear by Allah, we have not killed him. He then proceeded and came to his tribe and mentioned this to them. Then he, his brother Huwayyasah, who was older to him, and 'Abd al-Rahman b. Sahl came forward (to the Prophet). Muhayyasah began to speak. It was he who was at Khaibar. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said to him: Let the eldest (speak), let the eldest (speak), meaning age. So Huwayyasah spoke, and after him Muhayyasah spoke. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: They should either pay the bloodwit for you friend or they should be prepared for war. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote to them about it. They wrote (in reply): We swear by Allah, we have not killed him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said to Huwayyasah, Muhayyasah and 'Abd al-Rahman: Will you take an oath and thus have the claim to the blood of your friend ? They said: No. He (the Prophet) said: The Jews will then take an oath. They said: They are not Muslims. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) himself paid the bloodwit. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then sent on one hundred she-camels and they were entered in their house. Sahl said: A red she-camel of them gave me a kick","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":41,"hadith":28}}]}
