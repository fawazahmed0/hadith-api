He said: A surah has been revealed to me just now, and then he recited: “In the name of Allah, Most Gracious. Most Merciful. To thee We have granted the fount (of abundance)” up to the end. When he recited, he asked: Do you know what al-kauthar is? They replied: Allah and his Apostle know best. He said: It is a river which my Lord, the Exalted, has promised me( to grant) in Paradise: there is abundance of good and upon it there is a pond which my people will approach on the Day of Resurrection. There are vessels as numerous as stars(in the sky)",
