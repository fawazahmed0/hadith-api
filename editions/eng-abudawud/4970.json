He said: Give yourself the kunyah by Abdullah, your son - that is to say, her nephew (her sister's son). Musaddad said: Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr. She was called by the kunyah Umm Abdullah. Abu Dawud said: Qurran b. Tammam and Ma'mar all have transmitted it from Hisham in a similar manner. It has also been transmitted by Abu Usamah from Hisham, from 'Abbad b. Hamzah. Similarly, Hammad b. Salamah and Maslamah b. Qa'nab have narrated it from Hisham, like the tradition transmitted by Abu Usamah",
