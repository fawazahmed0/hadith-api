He asked me: Is it something doubtful? and he laughed. He then said: No one could escape that, until Allah, the exalted, revealed: \"If thou went in doubt as to what we have revealed unto thee, and ask those who have been reading the Book from before thee.\" He said: If you find something in your heart, say: He is the first and the Last, the Evident and the Immanent, and He has full knowledge of all things",
