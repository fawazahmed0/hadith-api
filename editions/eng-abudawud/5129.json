He replied: I have no mount to give, but go to so and so; he may perhaps give you a mount. He then went to him and he gave him a mount. He came to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) and informed him about it. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said: if anyone guides someone to a good (deed), he will get the reward like the reward of the one who does it",
