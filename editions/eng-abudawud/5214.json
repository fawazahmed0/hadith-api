He said: I shall tell you except that it is something secret. Did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) shake hands with you when you met him? He replied: I never met him without his shaking hands with me. One day he sent for me when I was not at home. When I came I was informed that he had sent for me. I came to him and found him on a couch. He embraced me and that was better and better",
