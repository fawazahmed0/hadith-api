These were made of the lote-tree of Urwah which Urwah used to cut from his hand? He said: There is no harm in it. Humayd's version adds: You have brought an innovation, O Iraqi! He said: The innovation is from you. I heard someone say at Mecca: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) cursed him who cuts a lote-tree. He then mentioned the rest of the tradition to the same effect",
