Samurah then said that he remembered two periods of silence from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ); one when he uttered the takbir and the other when he finished reciting: \"Not of those with whom Thou art angry, nor of those who go astray\" (i.7). Samurah remembered that, but Imran ibn Husayn rejected it. Then they wrote about it to Ubayy ibn Ka'b. He wrote a letter to them and gave a reply to them that Samurah remembered correctly",
