He was accompanied by the people whom he led in prayer. One day when he was leading them in the dawn (fajr) prayer, he said to them: One of you should come forward. He then went away to relieve himself. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: When any of you feels the need of relieving himself while the congregational prayer is ready, he should go to relieve himself",
