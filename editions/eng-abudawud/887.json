(verse 40), he should say: \"Certainly.\" And when one recites \"By those that are sent\" (Surah 77), and comes to \"Then in what message after that will they believe? \" (Surah 50), he should say: \"We believe in Allah.\" The narrator Isma'il (ibn Umayyah) said: I beg to repeat (this tradition) before the Bedouin (who reported this tradition) so that I might see whether he (was mistaken). He said: My nephew, do you think that I did not remember it? I performed sixty hajj (pilgrimages); there is no hajj but I recognize the came on which I performed it",
