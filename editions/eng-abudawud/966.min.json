Sahl al-Sa’id that he attended a company in which his father was also present. He then narrated this tradition saying:He(the Prophet) prostrated himself, he depended on his palms, knees and the toes of his feet. When he sat up, he sat on his hips, and raised his other foot. He then uttered the takbir(Allah is most great) and prostrated himself. He uttered the takbir and stood up and did not sit on his hips. Then he repeated(the same) and offered the second rak’ah; he uttered the takbir in the same manner, and sat up after two rak’ahs. When he was about to stand up, he stood up after saying the takbir. Then he offered the last two rak’ahs. When he saluted, he saluted on his right and left sides. Abu Dawud said: in this tradition there is no mention of sitting on hips and raising hands when he stood after two rak’ahs as narrated by ‘Abu al-Hamid","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":2,"hadith":577}}]}
