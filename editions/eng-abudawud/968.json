			"text": "‘Abd Allah b. Mas’ud said:when we (prayed and) sat up during prayer along the Messenger of Allah (may peach be upon him), we said: “Peace be to Allah before it is supplicated for His servants; peace be to so and so. “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do not say “Peace be to Allah ,”for Allah Himself is peace. When one of you sits(during the prayer), he should say: The adoration of the tongue are due to Allah, and acts of worship and all good things. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and Allah’s mercy and His blessings. Peace be upon us and upon Allah’s upright servants. When you say that, it reaches every upright servant in heavens and earth or between heavens and earth. I testify that there is no god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and apostle. Then he may choose any supplication which pleases him and offer it",
