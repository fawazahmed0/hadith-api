A man betrayed himself and had intercourse with his wife after he had offered the night prayer, and he did not break his fast. So Allah, the Exalted, intended to make it (fasting) easy for those who survived, thus providing a concession and utility. Allah, the Glorified, said: \"Allah knoweth what ye used to do secretly among yourselves.\" By this Allah benefited the people and provided concession and ease to them",

She replied “No”. Let me go and seek something for you. So, she went out and sleep overcame him. She came (back) and said (to him) .You are deprived (of food). He fainted before noon. He used to work all day long at his land. This was mentioned to the Prophet (ﷺ). So the following verse was revealed. “Permitted to you on the nights of the fasts, is the approach to your wives. They are your garments and ye are their garments. Allah knoweth what yes used to do secretly amongst yourselves. But he turned to you and forgave you. So now associate with them and seek what Allaah hath ordained for you. And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn appears to you. He recited up to the words “of dawn”",

When Umar observed this (his anger), he said: We are satisfied with Allah as Lord, with Islam as religion, and with Muhammad as Prophet. We seek refuge in Allah from the anger of Allah, and from the anger of His Apostle. Umar continued to repeat these words till his anger cooled down. He then asked: Messenger of Allah, what is the position of one who observes a perpetual fast? He replied: May he not fast or break his fast. Musaddad said in his version: He has neither fasted nor broken his fast. The narrator, Ghaylan, doubted the actual wordings. He asked: What is the position of one who fasts two days and does not fast one day? He said: Is anyone able to do that? He asked: What is the position of one who fasts every second day (i.e. fasts one day and does not fasts the next day)? He (the Prophet) said: This is the fast that David observed. He asked: Messenger of Allah, what is the position of one who fasts one day and breaks it for two days? He replied: I wish I were given the power to observe that. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The observance of three days' fast every month and of one Ramadan to the other (i.e. the fast of Ramadan every year) is (equivalent to) a perpetual fast. I seek from Allah that fasting on the day of Arafah may atone for the sins of the preceding and the coming year, and I seek from Allah that fasting on the day of Ashura' may atone for the sins of the preceding year",

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said on that day: A woman should not fast except with the permission of her husband.
