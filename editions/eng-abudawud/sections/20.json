But it occurred to him that he should take the camels back from them. He sent his son to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said to him: Go to the Prophet (ﷺ) and tell him: My father extends his greetings to you. He asked his people to give them one hundred camels if they embraced Islam, and they embraced Islam. He divided the camels among them. But it occurred to him then that he should withdraw his camels from them. Is he more entitled to them or we? If he says: Yes or no, then tell him: My father is an old man, and he is the chief of the people living at the water. He has requested you to make me chief after him. He came to him and said: My father has extended his greetings to you. He replied: On you and you father be peace. He said: My father asked his people to give them one hundred camels if they embraced Islam. So they embraced Islam, and their belief in Islam is good. Then it occurred to him that he should take his camels back from them. Is he more entitled to them or are they? He said: If he likes to give them the camels, he may give them; and if he likes to take them back, he is more entitled to them than his people. If they embraced Islam, then for them is their Islam. If they do not embrace Islam, they will be fought against in the cause of Islam. He said: My father is an old man; he is the chief of the people living at the spring. He has asked you to appoint me chief after him. He replied: The office of a chief is necessary, for people must have chiefs, but the chiefs will go to Hell",

When I entered upon him, he said: Malik, some people of you tribe gradually came here, and I have ordered to give them something, so distribute it among them. I said: If you assigned this (work) to some other person, (it would be better). He said: Take it. Then Yarfa' came to him and said: Commander of the Faithful, will you permit 'Uthman b. 'Affan, 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf, al-Zubair b. al-'Awwam, and Sa'd b, Abi Waqqas (to enter) ? He said: Yes. So he permitted them and they entered. Yarfa' again came to him and said: Commander of the Faithful, would you permit al-'Abbas and 'Ali ? He said: Yes. He then permitted them and they entered. Al-'Abbas said: Commander of Faithful, decide between me and this, referring to 'Ali. Some of them said: Yes, Commander of the Faithful, decide between them and give them comfort. Malik b. Aws said: It occurred to me that both of them brought the other people for this. 'Umar said: Show patience (do not make haste). He then turned towards those people and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: We are not inherited whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). They said: Yes. He then turned towards 'Ali and al-'Abbas and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: We are not inherited whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). They said: Yes. He then said: Allah has appointed for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) a special portion (in the booty) which he did not do for anyone. Allah, Most High, said: What Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (and taken away) from them - for this ye made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry. But Allah gives power to His apostles over any He pleases ; and Allah has power over all things\". Allah bestowed (the property of) Banu al-Nadir on His Apostle. I swear by Allah, he did not reserve it for himself, nor did he take it over and above you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to his share for his maintenance annually, or used to take his contribution and give his family their annual contribution (from this property), then take what remained and deal with it as he did with Allah's property. He then turned towards those people and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that ? They said: Yes. He then turned towards 'Ali and al-'Abbas and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that ? They said: Yes. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died, Abu Bakr said: I am the protector of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Then you and this ('Ali) came to Abu Bakr, demanding a share from the inheritance of your cousin, and this ('Ali) demanding the share of his wife from (the property of her) father. Abu Bakr then said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah. Allah knows that he (Abu Bakr) was true, faithful, rightly-guided, and the follower of Triuth. Abu Bakr then administered it (property of the Prophet). When Abu Bakr died, I said: I am the protector of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr. So I administered whatever Allah wished. Then you and this ('Ali) came. Both of you are at one, and your matter is the same. So they asked me for it (property), and I said: If you wish I give it to you on condition that you are bound by the covenant of Allah, meaning that you will administer it as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to administer. So you took it from me on that condition. Then again you have come to me so that I decide between you other than that. I swear by Allah, I shall not decide between you other than that till the Last Hour comes. If you helpless, return it to me. Abu Dawud said: They asked him for making it half between them, and not that they were ignorant of the fact the Prophet (ﷺ) said: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). They were also seeking the truth. 'Umar then said: I do not apply the name of division to it ; It leave it on its former condition",

Messenger of Allah, you are the kindest of the people and the most skilled in matchmaking. Our fathers have nothing with which to pay our dower. So appoint us collector of sadaqah (zakat), Messenger of Allah, and we shall give you what the other collectors give you, and we shall have the benefit accruing from it. Ali came to us while we were in this condition. He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: No, I swear by Allah, he will not appoint any of you collector of sadaqah (zakat). Rabi'ah said to him: This is your condition; you have gained your relationship with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) by marriage, but we did not grudge you that. Ali then put his cloak on the earth and lay on it. He then said: I am the father of Hasan, the chief. I swear by Allah, I shall not leave this place until your sons come with a reply (to the question) for which you have sent them to the Prophet (ﷺ). AbdulMuttalib said: So I and al-Fadl went towards the door of the apartment of the Prophet (ﷺ). We found that the noon prayer in congregation had already started. So we prayed along with the people. I and al-Fadl then hastened towards the door of the apartment of the Prophet (ﷺ). He was (staying) with Zaynab, daughter of Jahsh, that day. We stood until the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came. He caught my ear and the ear of al-Fadl. He then said: Reveal what you conceal in your hearts. He then entered and permitted me and al-Fadl (to enter). So we entered and for a little while we asked each other to talk. I then talked to him, or al-Fadl talked to him (the narrator, Abdullah was not sure). He said: He spoke to him concerning the matter about which our fathers ordered us to ask him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remained silent for a moment and raised his eyes towards the ceiling of the room. He took so long that we thought he would not give any reply to us. Meanwhile we saw that Zaynab was signalling to us with her hand from behind the veil, asking us not to be in a hurry, and that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was (thinking) about our matter. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then lowered his head and said to us: This sadaqah (zakat) is a dirt of the people. It is legal neither for Muhammad nor for the family of Muhammad. Call Nawfal ibn al-Harith to me. So Nawfal ibn al-Harith was called to him. He said: Nawfal, marry AbdulMuttalib (to your daughter). So Nawfal married me (to his daughter). The Prophet (ﷺ) then said: Call Mahmiyyah ibn Jaz'i to me. He was a man of Banu Zubayd, whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had appointed collector of the fifths. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to Mahmiyyah: Marry al-Fadl (to your daughter). So he married him to her. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Stand up and pay the dower from the fifth so-and-so on their behalf. Abdullah ibn al-Harith did not name it (i.e. the amount of the dower)",

I could not control my eyes (to weep) when I saw that scene. I said “Who has done this?” They (the people) replied “Hamzah bin ‘Abd Al Muttalib”. He is among the drunkards of the Ansar in this house. A singing girl is singing for him and his Companions. While singing she said “Oh Hamza, rise to these plumpy old she Camels. So he jumped to the sword and cut off their humps, pierced their hips and took out their livers.” ‘Ali said “I went till I entered upon the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) while Zaid bin Harithah was with him.” The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) realized what I had met with. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) aid “What is the matter with you?” I said Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), I never saw the thing that happened with me today. Hamzah wronged my she Camels, he cut off their humps, pierced their hips. Lo! He is in a house with drunkards. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) asked for his cloak. It was brought to him. He then went out, I and Zaid bin Harithah followed him until we reached the house where Hamzah was. He asked permission ( to entre). He was permitted. He found drunkards there. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) began to rebuke him (Hamzah) for his action. Hamzah was intoxicated and his eyes were reddish. Hamzah looked at the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). He then raised his eyes and looked at his knees, he then raised his eyes and looked at his navel and he then raised his eyes and looked at his face. Hamzah then said “Are you but the salves of my father? Then the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) knew that he was intoxicated. So the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) moved backward. He then went out and we also went out with him.”",

They used to hurt the Prophet (ﷺ) and his Companions. Then Allaah Most High commanded His Prophet to show patience and forgiveness. So Allaah revealed about them “And ye shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who receive Book before you”. When Ka’ab bin Al Ashraf refused to desist from hurting the Prophet (ﷺ) the Prophet(ﷺ) ordered Sa’d bin Mu’adh to send a band to kill him. He sent Muhammad bin Maslamah and mentioned the story of his murder. When they killed him, the Jews and the polytheist were frightened. Next day they came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said “Our Companions were attacked and night and killed.” The Prophet(ﷺ) informed them about that which he would say. The Prophet (ﷺ) then called them so that he could write a deed of agreement between him and them and they should fulfill its provisions and desist from hurting him.

			"text": "Narrated A man from the companions of the Prophet: AbdurRahman ibn Ka'b ibn Malik reported on the authority of a man from among the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ): The infidels of the Quraysh wrote (a letter) to Ibn Ubayy and to those who worshipped idols from al-Aws and al-Khazraj, while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was at that time at Medina before the battle of Badr. (They wrote): You gave protection to our companion. We swear by Allah, you should fight him or expel him, or we shall come to you in full force, until we kill your fighters and appropriate your women. When this (news) reached Abdullah ibn Ubayy and those who were worshippers of idols, with him they gathered together to fight the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When this news reached the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he visited them and said: The threat of the Quraysh to you has reached its end. They cannot contrive a plot against you, greater than what you yourselves intended to harm you. Are you willing to fight your sons and brethren? When they heard this from the Prophet (ﷺ), they scattered. This reached the infidels of the Quraysh. The infidels of the Quraysh again wrote (a letter) to the Jews after the battle of Badr: You are men of weapons and fortresses. You should fight our companion or we shall deal with you in a certain way. And nothing will come between us and the anklets of your women. When their letter reached the Prophet (ﷺ), they gathered Banu an-Nadir to violate the treaty. They sent a message to the Prophet (ﷺ): Come out to us with thirty men from your companions, and thirty rabbis will come out from us till we meet at a central place where they will hear you. If they testify to you and believe in you, we shall believe in you. The narrator then narrated the whole story. When the next day came, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out in the morning with an army, and surrounded them. He told them: I swear by Allah, you will have no peace from me until you conclude a treaty with me. But they refused to conclude a treaty with him. He therefore fought them the same day. Next he attacked Banu Quraysh with an army in the morning, and left Banu an-Nadir. He asked them to sign a treaty and they signed it. He turned away from them and attacked Banu an-Nadir with an army. He fought with them until they agreed to expulsion. Banu an-Nadir were deported, and they took with them whatever their camels could carry, that is, their property, the doors of their houses, and their wood. Palm-trees were exclusively reserved for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Allah bestowed them upon him and gave them him as a special portion. He (Allah), the Exalted, said: What Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (and taken away) from them, for this ye made no expedition with either camel corps or cavalry.\" He said: \"Without fighting.\" So the Prophet (ﷺ) gave most of it to the emigrants and divided it among them; and he divided some of it between two men from the helpers, who were needy, and he did not divide it among any of the helpers except those two. The rest of it survived as the sadaqah of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) which is in the hands of the descendants of Fatimah (Allah be pleased with her)",

He said: He had nothing. It was I who managed it on his behalf since the day Allah made him Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) until he died. When a Muslim man came to him and he found him naked, he ordered me (to clothe him). I would go, borrow (some money), and purchase a cloak for him. I would then clothe him and feed him. A man from the polytheists met me and said: I am well off, Bilal. Do not borrow money from anyone except me. So I did accordingly. One day when I performed ablution and stood up to make call to prayer, the same polytheist came along with a body of merchants. When he saw me, he said: O Abyssinian. I said: I am at your service. He met me with unpleasant looks and said harsh words to me. He asked me: Do you know how many days remain in the completion of this month? I replied: The time is near. He said: Only four days remain in the completion of this month. I shall then take that which is due from you (i.e. loan), and then shall return you to tend the sheep as you did before. I began to think in my mind what people think in their minds (on such occasions). When I offered the night prayer, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) returned to his family. I sought permission from him and he gave me permission. I said: Messenger of Allah, may my parents be sacrificed for you, the polytheist from whom I used to borrow money said to me such-and-such. Neither you nor I have anything to pay him for me, and he will disgrace me. So give me permission to run away to some of those tribes who have recently embraced Islam until Allah gives His Apostle (ﷺ) something with which he can pay (the debt) for me. So I came out and reached my house. I placed my sword, waterskin (or sheath), shoes and shield near my head. When dawn broke, I intended to be on my way. All of a sudden I saw a man running towards me and calling: Bilal, return to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). So I went till I reached him. I found four mounts kneeling on the ground with loads on them. I sought permission. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: Be glad, Allah has made arrangements for the payment (of your debt). He then asked: Have you not seen the four mounts kneeling on the ground? I replied: Yes. He said: You may have these mounts and what they have on them. There are clothes and food on them, presented to me by the ruler of Fadak. Take them away and pay off your debt. I did so. He then mentioned the rest of the tradition. I then went to the mosque and found that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting there. I greeted him. He asked: What benefit did you have from your property? I replied: Allah Most High paid everything which was due from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Nothing remains now. He asked: Did anything remain (from that property)? I said: Yes. He said: Look, if you can give me some comfort from it, for I shall not visit any member of my family until you give me some comfort from it. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered the night prayer, he called me and said: What is the position of that which you had with you (i.e. property)? I said: I still have it, no one came to me. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed the night in the mosque. He then narrated the rest of the tradition. Next day when he offered the night prayer, he called me and asked: What is the position of that which you had (i.e. the rest of the property)? I replied: Allah has given you comfort from it, Messenger of Allah. He said: Allah is Most Great, and praised Allah, fearing lest he should die while it was with him. I then followed him until he came to his wives and greeted each one of them and finally he came to his place where he had to pass the night. This is all for which you asked me",

He took the oath of allegiance of Islam for himself and for his people. He then said: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), write a document for us, giving us the land lying between us and Banu Tamim at ad-Dahna' to the effect that not one of them will cross it in our direction except a traveller or a passer-by. He said: Write down ad-Dahna' for them, boy. When I saw that he passed orders to give it to him, I became anxious, for it was my native land and my home. I said: Messenger of Allah, he did not ask you for a true border when he asked you. This land of Dahna' is a place where the camels have their home, and it is a pasture for the sheep. The women of Banu Tamim and their children are beyond it. He said: Stop, boy! A poor woman spoke the truth: a Muslim is a brother of a Muslim. Each one of them may benefit from water and trees, and they should cooperate with each other against Satan",
