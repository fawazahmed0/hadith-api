There is no rain (drought), the trees have dried and the livestock are destroyed; Please pray to Allah for rain.\" So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said twice, \"O Allah! Bless us with rain.\" By Allah, there was no trace of cloud in the sky and suddenly the sky became overcast with clouds and it started raining. The Prophet (ﷺ) came down the pulpit and offered the prayer. When he came back from the prayer (to his house) it was raining and it rained continuously till the next Friday. When the Prophet started delivering the Friday Khutba (sermon), the people started shouting and said to him, \"The houses have collapsed and the roads are cut off; so please pray to Allah to withhold the rain.\" So the Prophet (ﷺ) smiled and said, \"O Allah! Round about us and not on us.\" So the sky became clear over Medina but it kept on raining over the outskirts (of Medina) and not a single drop of rain fell over Median. I looked towards the sky which was as bright and clear as a crown","grades":[],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":16}}]}
