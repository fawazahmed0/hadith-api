She said to her, \"May Allah give you refuge from the punishment of the grave.\" So `Aisha ' asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \"Would the people be punished in their graves?\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) after seeking refuge with Allah from the punishment of the grave (and thus replied in the affirmative). Then one day, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) rode to go to some place but the sun eclipsed. He returned in the forenoon and passed through the rear of the dwellings (of his wives) and stood for the (eclipse) prayer, and the people stood behind him. He stood up for a long period and then performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first bowing. Then he raised his head and prostrated. Then he stood up (for the second rak`a) for a long while but the standing was shorter than that of the first rak`a. Then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first one. Then he raised his head and prostrated. Then he stood up for a long time but shorter than the first. Then he performed a prolonged bowing but shorter than the first. Then he raised his head and prostrated and finished the prayer and (then delivered the sermon and) said as much as Allah wished.
