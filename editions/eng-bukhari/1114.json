The time for the prayer became due and he offered the prayer while sitting and we prayed while standing. He said, \"The Imam is to be followed; so if he says Takbir, you should also say Takbir, and if he bows you should also bow; and when he lifts his head you should also do the same and if he says: Sami`a l-lahu liman hamidah (Allah hears whoever sends his praises to Him) you should say: Rabbana walakal-Hamd (O our Lord! All the praises are for You.\") (See Hadith No. 656 Vol. 1)",
