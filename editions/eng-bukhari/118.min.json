Had it not been for two verses in the Qur'an, I would not have narrated a single Hadith, and the verses are: \"Verily those who conceal the clear sign and the guidance which We have sent down . . . (up to) Most Merciful.\" (2:159-160). And no doubt our Muhajir (emigrant) brothers used to be busy in the market with their business (bargains) and our Ansari brothers used to be busy with their property (agriculture). But I (Abu Huraira) used to stick to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) contented with what will fill my stomach and I used to attend that which they used not to attend and I used to memorize that which they used not to memorize","grades":[],"reference":{"book":3,"hadith":60}}]}
