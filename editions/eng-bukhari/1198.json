			"text": "Narrated Kuraib Maula Ibn `Abbas:`Abdullah bin `Abbas said that he had passed a night in the house of Maimuna the mother of the faithful believers , who was his aunt. He said, \"I slept across the bed, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) along with his wife slept lengthwise. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) slept till midnight or slightly before or after it. Then Allah's Apostle woke up, sat, and removed the traces of sleep by rubbing his hands over his face. Then he recited the last ten verses of Surat-Al `Imran (2). Then he went towards a hanging leather watercontainer and performed a perfect ablution and then stood up for prayer.\" `Abdullah bin `Abbas added, \"I got up and did the same as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had done and then went and stood by his side. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then put his right hand over my head and caught my right ear and twisted it. He offered two rak`at, then two rak`at, then two rak`at, then two rak`at, then two rak`at, then two rak`at and then offered one rak`a witr. Then he lay down till the Mu'adh-dhin came and then he prayed two light rak`at and went out and offered the early morning (Fajr) prayer",
