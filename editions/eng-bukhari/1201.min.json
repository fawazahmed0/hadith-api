Will you lead the people in the prayer?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"Yes, if you wish.\" So Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr led the prayer. In the meantime the Prophet (ﷺ) came crossing the rows (of the praying people) till he stood in the first row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr never looked hither and thither during the prayer but when the people clapped too much, he looked back and saw the Prophet (ﷺ) in the (first) row. The Prophet (ﷺ) waved him to remain at his place, but Abu Bakr raised both his hands and sent praises to Allah and then retreated and the Prophet (ﷺ) went forward and led the prayer.
