So I felt so sorry that only Allah knows it and I said to myself,, 'Perhaps Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is angry because I did not come quickly, then again I greeted him but he did not reply. I felt even more sorry than I did the first time. Again I greeted him and he returned the greeting and said, \"The thing which prevented me from returning the greeting was that I was praying.\" And at that time he was on his Rahila and his face was not towards the Qibla",
