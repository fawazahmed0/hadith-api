We went to attend her funeral procession. Ibn `Umar and Ibn `Abbas were also present. I sat in between them (or said, I sat beside one of them. Then a man came and sat beside me.) `Abdullah bin `Umar said to `Amr bin `Uthman, \"Will you not prohibit crying as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has said, 'The dead person is tortured by the crying of his relatives.?\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"`Umar used to say so.\" Then he added narrating, \"I accompanied `Umar on a journey from Mecca till we reached Al-Baida. There he saw some travelers in the shade of a Samura (A kind of forest tree). He said (to me), \"Go and see who those travelers are.\" So I went and saw that one of them was Suhaib. I told this to `Umar who then asked me to call him. So I went back to Suhaib and said to him, \"Depart and follow the chief of the faithful believers.\" Later, when `Umar was stabbed, Suhaib came in weeping and saying, \"O my brother, O my friend!\" (on this `Umar said to him, \"O Suhaib! Are you weeping for me while the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"The dead person is punished by some of the weeping of his relatives?\" Ibn `Abbas added, \"When `Umar died I told all this to Aisha and she said, 'May Allah be merciful to `Umar. By Allah, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not say that a believer is punished by the weeping of his relatives. But he said, Allah increases the punishment of a non-believer because of the weeping of his relatives.\" Aisha further added, \"The Qur'an is sufficient for you (to clear up this point) as Allah has stated: 'No burdened soul will bear another's burden.' \" (35.18). Ibn `Abbas then said, \"Only Allah makes one laugh or cry.\" Ibn `Umar did not say anything after that","grades":[],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":0}}]}
