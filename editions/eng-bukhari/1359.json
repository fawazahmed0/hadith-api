Do you find it mutilated?\" Then Abu Huraira recited the holy verses: \"The pure Allah's Islamic nature (true faith of Islam) (i.e. worshipping none but Allah) with which He has created human beings. No change let there be in the religion of Allah (i.e. joining none in worship with Allah). That is the straight religion (Islam) but most of men know, not.\" (30.30)",
