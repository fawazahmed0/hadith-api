Such a person will (then) say, 'O Muhammad! (please intercede for me,) I will say to him. 'I can't help you, for I conveyed Allah's Message to you.' Similarly, I do not want anyone of you to come to me carrying over his neck a camel that will be grunting. Such a person (then) will say \"O Muhammad! (please intercede for me).\" I will say to him, \"I can't help you for I conveyed Allah's message to you",
