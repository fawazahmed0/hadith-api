And they (the people) said, \"He is showing off.\" And another man came and gave a Sa (a small measure of food grains); they said, \"Allah is not in need of this small amount of charity.\" And then the Divine Inspiration came: \"Those who criticize such of the believers who give in charity voluntarily and those who could not find to give in charity except what is available to them.\" (9.79)",
