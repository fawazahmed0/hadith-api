After finishing the prayer, he delivered the sermon and ordered the people to give alms. He said, \"O people! Give alms.\" Then he went towards the women and said. \"O women! Give alms, for I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-Fire were you (women).\" The women asked, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What is the reason for it?\" He replied, \"O women! You curse frequently, and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. O women, some of you can lead a cautious wise man astray.\" Then he left. And when he reached his house, Zainab, the wife of Ibn Mas`ud, came and asked permission to enter It was said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! It is Zainab.\" He asked, 'Which Zainab?\" The reply was that she was the wife of Ibn Mas'ub. He said, \"Yes, allow her to enter.\" And she was admitted. Then she said, \"O Prophet of Allah! Today you ordered people to give alms and I had an ornament and intended to give it as alms, but Ibn Mas`ud said that he and his children deserved it more than anybody else.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, \"Ibn Mas`ud had spoken the truth. Your husband and your children had more right to it than anybody else","grades":[],"reference":{"book":24,"hadith":64}}]}
