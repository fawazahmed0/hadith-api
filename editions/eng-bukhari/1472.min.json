Again I asked and he gave (it to me). Again I asked and he gave (it to me). And then he said, \"O Hakim! This property is like a sweet fresh fruit; whoever takes it without greediness, he is blessed in it, and whoever takes it with greediness, he is not blessed in it, and he is like a person who eats but is never satisfied; and the upper (giving) hand is better than the lower (receiving) hand.\" Hakim added, \"I said to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) , 'By Him (Allah) Who sent you with the Truth, I shall never accept anything from anybody after you, till I leave this world.' \" Then Abu Bakr (during his caliphate) called Hakim to give him his share from the war booty (like the other companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) ), he refused to accept anything. Then `Umar (during his caliphate) called him to give him his share but he refused. On that `Umar said, \"O Muslims! I would like you to witness that I offered Hakim his share from this booty and he refused to take it.\" So Hakim never took anything from anybody after the Prophet (ﷺ) till he died","grades":[],"reference":{"book":24,"hadith":74}}]}
