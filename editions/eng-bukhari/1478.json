			"text": "Narrated Sa`d (bin Abi Waqqas):Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) distributed something (from the resources of Zakat) amongst a group of people while I was sitting amongst them, but he left a man whom I considered the best of the lot. So, I went up to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and asked him secretly, \"Why have you left that person? By Allah! I consider him a believer.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Or merely a Muslim (Who surrender to Allah).\" I remained quiet for a while but could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. I said, \"O Allah's Apostle! Why have you left that person? By Allah! I consider him a believer. \" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Or merely a Muslim.\" I remained quiet for a while but could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Why have you left that person? By Allah! I consider him a believer.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Or merely a Muslim.\" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) said, \"I give to a person while another is dearer to me, for fear that he may be thrown in the Hell-fire on his face (by reneging from Islam)",
