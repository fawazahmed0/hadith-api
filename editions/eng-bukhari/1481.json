			"text": "Narrated Abu Humaid As-Sa`idi:We took part in the holy battle of Tabuk in the company of the Prophet (ﷺ) and when we arrived at the Wadi-al-Qura, there was a woman in her garden. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked his companions to estimate the amount of the fruits in the garden, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) estimated it at ten Awsuq (One Wasaq = 60 Sa's) and 1 Sa'= 3 kg. approximately). The Prophet (ﷺ) said to that lady, \"Check what your garden will yield.\" When we reached Tabuk, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"There will be a strong wind tonight and so no one should stand and whoever has a camel, should fasten it.\" So we fastened our camels. A strong wind blew at night and a man stood up and he was blown away to a mountain called Taiy, The King of Aila sent a white mule and a sheet for wearing to the Prophet (ﷺ) as a present, and wrote to the Prophet (ﷺ) that his people would stay in their place (and will pay Jizya taxation.) (1) When the Prophet (ﷺ) reached Wadi-al- Qura he asked that woman how much her garden had yielded. She said, \"Ten Awsuq,\" and that was what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had estimated. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I want to reach Medina quickly, and whoever among you wants to accompany me, should hurry up.\" The sub-narrator Ibn Bakkar said something which meant: When the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saw Medina he said, \"This is Taba.\" And when he saw the mountain of Uhud, he said, \"This mountain loves us and we love it. Shall I tell you of the best amongst the Ansar?\" They replied in the affirmative. He said, \"The family of Bani-n-Najjar, and then the family of Bani Sa`ida or Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj. (The above-mentioned are the best) but there is goodness in all the families of Ansar",
