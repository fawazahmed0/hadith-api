The Prophet (ﷺ) turned Al-Fadl's face to the other side. The woman said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! The obligation of Hajj enjoined by Allah on His devotees has become due on my father and he is old and weak, and he cannot sit firm on the Mount; may I perform Hajj on his behalf?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, \"Yes, you may.\" That happened during the Hajj-al-Wida (of the Prophet (ﷺ)",
