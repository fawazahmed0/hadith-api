What is your verdict regarding that person who assumes Ihram for 'Umra and is scented with perfume ?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) kept quiet for a while and he was Divinely inspired (then). 'Umar beckoned Ya'la. So he came, and the Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was shaded with sheet. Ya'la put his head in and saw that the face of Allah's Messenger was red and he was snoring. When the state of the Prophet (ﷺ) was over, he (ﷺ) asked, \"Where is the person who asked about 'Umra?\" Then that person was brought and the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Wash the perfume off your body thrice and take off the cloak and do the same in 'Umra as you do in Hajj","grades":[],"reference":{"book":25,"hadith":24}}]}
