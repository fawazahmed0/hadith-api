What is the matter?\" He said, If you want to follow the Sunna (the tradition of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) then proceed (to `Arafat).\" Al-Hajjaj asked, \"At this very hour?\" Ibn `Umar said, \"Yes.\" He replied, \"Please wait for me till I pour some water over my head (i.e. take a bath) and come out.\" Then Ibn `Umar dismounted and waited till Al-Hajjaj came out. So, he (Al-Hajjaj) walked in between me and my father (Ibn `Umar). I said to him, \"If you want to follow the Sunna then deliver a brief sermon and hurry up for the stay at `Arafat.\" He started looking at `Abdullah (Ibn `Umar) (inquiringly), and when `Abdullah noticed that, he said that he had told the truth","grades":[],"reference":{"book":25,"hadith":141}}]}
