He performed light ablution and then I said to him: (Is it the time for) the prayer, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" He replied, \"The (place of) prayer is ahead of you (i.e. at Al- Muzdalifa).\" So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) rode till he reached Al-Muzdalifa and then he offered the prayer (there) . Then in the morning (10th Dhul-Hijja) Al-Faql (bin `Abbas) rode behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).
