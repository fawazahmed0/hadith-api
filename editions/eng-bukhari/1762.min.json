The Prophet (ﷺ) reached Mecca and performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba and between Safa and Marwa and did not finish the Ihram, because he had the Hadi with him. His companions and his wives performed Tawaf (of the Ka`ba and between Safa and Marwa), and those who had no Hadi with them finished their Ihram. I got the menses and performed all the ceremonies of Hajj. So, when the Night of Hasba (night of departure) came, I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! All your companions are returning with Hajj and `Umra except me.\" He asked me, \"Didn't you perform Tawaf of the Ka`ba (Umra) when you reached Mecca?\" I said, \"No.\" He said, \"Go to Tan`im with your brother `Abdur-Rahman, and assume Ihram for `Umra and I will wait for you at such and such a place.\" So I went with `Abdur-Rahman to Tan`im and assumed Ihram for `Umra. Then Safiya bint Huyay got menses. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \" 'Aqra Halqa! You will detain us! Didn't you perform Tawaf-al-Ifada on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?\" She said, \"Yes, I did.\" He said, \"Then there is no harm, depart.\" So I met the Prophet (ﷺ) when he was ascending the heights towards Mecca and I was descending, or vice-versa","grades":[],"reference":{"book":25,"hadith":238}}]}
