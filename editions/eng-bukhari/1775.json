			"text": "Narrated Mujahid:Urwa bin Az-Zubair and I entered the Mosque (of the Prophet) and saw `Abdullah bin `Umar sitting near the dwelling place of Aisha and some people were offering the Duha prayer. We asked him about their prayer and he replied that it was a heresy. He (Urwa) then asked him how many times the Prophet (ﷺ) had performed `Umra. He replied, 'Four times; one of them was in the month of Rajab.\" We disliked to contradict him. Then we heard `Aisha, the Mother of faithful believers cleaning her teeth with Siwak in the dwelling place. 'Urwa said, \"O Mother! O Mother of the believers! Don't you hear what Abu `Abdur Rahman is saying?\" She said, \"What does he say?\" 'Urwa said, \"He says that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) performed four `Umra and one of them was in the month of Rajab.\" `Aisha said, \"May Allah be merciful to Abu `Abdur Rahman! The Prophet (ﷺ) did not perform any `Umra except that he was with him, and he never performed any `Umra in Rajab",
