Abu Qatada narrated through another group of narrators: We were in the company of the Prophet (ﷺ) at a place called Al-Qaha and some of us had assumed Ihram while the others had not. I noticed that some of my companions were watching something, so I looked up and saw an onager. (I rode my horse and took the spear and whip) but my whip fell down (and I asked them to pick it up for me) but they said, \"We will not help you by any means as we are in a state of Ihram.\" So, I picked up the whip myself and attacked the onager from behind a hillock and slaughtered it and brought it to my companions. Some of them said, \"Eat it.\" While some others said, \"Do not eat it.\" So, I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) who was ahead of us and asked him about it, He replied, \"Eat it as it is Halal (i.e. it is legal to eat it)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":28,"hadith":3}}]}
