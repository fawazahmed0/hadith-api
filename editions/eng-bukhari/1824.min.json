The Prophet (ﷺ) said to them, \"Proceed along the seashore till we meet all together.\" So, they took the route of the seashore, and when they started all of them assumed Ihram except Abu Qatada. While they were proceeding on, his companions saw a group of onagers. Abu Qatada chased the onagers and attacked and wounded a sheonager. They got down and ate some of its meat and said to each other: \"How do we eat the meat of the game while we are in a state of Ihram?\" So, we (they) carried the rest of the she-onager's meat, and when they met Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) they asked, saying, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We assumed Ihram with the exception of Abu Qatada and we saw (a group) of onagers. Abu Qatada attacked them and wounded a she-onager from them. Then we got down and ate from its meat. Later, we said, (to each other), 'How do we eat the meat of the game and we are in a state of Ihram?' So, we carried the rest of its meat. The Prophet asked, \"Did anyone of you order Abu Qatada to attack it or point at it?\" They replied in the negative. He said, \"Then eat what is left of its meat","grades":[],"reference":{"book":28,"hadith":4}}]}
