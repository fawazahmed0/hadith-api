I greeted him and he asked who I was. I replied, \"I am `Abdullah bin Hunain and I have been sent to you by Ibn `Abbas to ask you how Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to wash his head while in the state of lhram.\" Abu Aiyub Al-Ansari caught hold of the sheet of cloth and lowered it till his head appeared before me, and then told somebody to pour water on his head. He poured water on his head, and he (Abu Aiyub) rubbed his head with his hands by bringing them from back to front and from front to back and said, \"I saw the Prophet (ﷺ) doing like this","grades":[],"reference":{"book":28,"hadith":20}}]}
