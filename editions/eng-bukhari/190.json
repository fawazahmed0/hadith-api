This son of my sister has got a disease in his legs.\" So he passed his hands on my head and prayed for Allah's blessings for me; then he performed ablution and I drank from the remaining water. I stood behind him and saw the seal of Prophethood between his shoulders, and it was like the \"Zir-al-Hijla\" (means the button of a small tent, but some said 'egg of a partridge.' etc)",
