I have been ruined.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked what was the matter with him. He replied \"I had sexual intercourse with my wife while I was fasting.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked him, \"Can you afford to manumit a slave?\" He replied in the negative. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked him, \"Can you fast for two successive months?\" He replied in the negative. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked him, \"Can you afford to feed sixty poor persons?\" He replied in the negative.

He asked, \"Where is the questioner?\" He replied, \"I (am here).\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), \"Take this (basket of dates) and give it in charity.\" The man said, \"Should I give it to a person poorer than I?
