(I can fast more).\" He said, \"Five?\" I replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! (I can fast more).\" He said, \"Seven?\" I replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! (I can fast more).\" He said, \"Nine (days per month)?\" I replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! (I can fast more)\" He said, \"Eleven (days per month)?\" And then the Prophet said, \"There is no fast superior to that of the Prophet (ﷺ) David it was for half of the year. So, fast on alternate days",
