When the Prophet (ﷺ) noticed him, he called him and said, \"Come here. She is Safiya. (Sufyan a sub-narrator perhaps said that the Prophet (ﷺ) had said, \"This is Safiya\"). And Satan circulates in the body of Adam's offspring as his blood circulates in it.\" (A sub-narrator asked Sufyan, \"Did Safiya visit him at night?\" He said, \"Of course, at night)",
