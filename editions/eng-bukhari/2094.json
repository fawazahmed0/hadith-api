He replied, \"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent for a woman (Sahl named her) (this message): 'Order your slave carpenter to make pieces of wood (i.e. a pulpit) for me so that I may sit on it while addressing the people.' So, she ordered him to make it from the tamarisk of the forest. He brought it to her and she sent it to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered it to be placed in the mosque: so, it was put and he sat on it",
