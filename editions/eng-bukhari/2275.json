He said, \"I will not pay you unless you disbelieve in Muhammad.\" I said, \"By Allah! I will never do that till you die and be resurrected.\" He said, \"Will I be dead and then resurrected after my death?\" I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"There I will have property and offspring and then I will pay you your due.\" Then Allah revealed. 'Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our signs, and yet says: I will be given property and offspring?' (19.77)",
