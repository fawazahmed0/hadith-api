			"text": "Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:I was accompanying the Prophet (ﷺ) on a journey and was riding a slow camel that was lagging behind the others. The Prophet (ﷺ) passed by me and asked, \"Who is this?\" I replied, \"Jabir bin `Abdullah.\" He asked, \"What is the matter, (why are you late)?\" I replied, \"I am riding a slow camel.\" He asked, \"Do you have a stick?\" I replied in the affirmative. He said, \"Give it to me.\" When I gave it to him, he beat the camel and rebuked it. Then that camel surpassed the others thenceforth. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Sell it to me.\" I replied, \"It is (a gift) for you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" He said, \"Sell it to me. I have bought it for four Dinars (gold pieces) and you can keep on riding it till Medina.\" When we approached Medina, I started going (towards my house). The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Where are you going?\" I Sa`d, \"I have married a widow.\" He said, \"Why have you not married a virgin to fondle with each other?\" I said, \"My father died and left daughters, so I decided to marry a widow (an experienced woman) (to look after them).\" He said, \"Well done.\" When we reached Medina, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"O Bilal, pay him (the price of the camel) and give him extra money.\" Bilal gave me four Dinars and one Qirat extra. (A sub-narrator said): Jabir added, \"The extra Qirat of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) never parted from me.\" The Qirat was always in Jabir bin `Abdullah's purse",
