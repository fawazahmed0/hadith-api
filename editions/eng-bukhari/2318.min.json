Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter it and drink from its sweet water. When the following Divine Verse were revealed: 'you will not attain righteousness till you spend in charity of the things you love' (3.92), Abu Talha got up in front of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah says in His Book, 'You will not attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) that which you love,' and verily, the most beloved to me of my property is Beeruha (garden), so I give it in charity and hope for its reward from Allah. O Allah's Apostle! Spend it wherever you like.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) appreciated that and said, \"That is perishable wealth, that is perishable wealth. I have heard what you have said; I suggest you to distribute it among your relatives.\" Abu Talha said, \"I will do so, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" So, Abu Talha distributed it among his relatives and cousins. The sub-narrator (Malik) said: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"That is a profitable wealth,\" instead of \"perishable wealth","grades":[],"reference":{"book":40,"hadith":17}}]}
