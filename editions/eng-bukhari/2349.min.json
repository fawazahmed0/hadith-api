(Ya'qub, the sub-narrator said, \"I think the narrator mentioned that the food did not contain fat or melted fat (taken from meat).\") When we offered the Friday prayer we would go to her and she would serve us with the dish. So, we used to be happy on Fridays because of that. We used not to take our meals or the midday nap except after the Jumua prayer (i.e. Friday prayer)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":41,"hadith":27}}]}
