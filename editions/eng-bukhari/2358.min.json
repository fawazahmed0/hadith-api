They are: -1. A man possessed superfluous water, on a way and he withheld it from travelers. -2. A man who gave a pledge of allegiance to a ruler and he gave it only for worldly benefits. If the ruler gives him something he gets satisfied, and if the ruler withholds something from him, he gets dissatisfied. -3. And man displayed his goods for sale after the `Asr prayer and he said, 'By Allah, except Whom None has the right to be worshipped, I have been given so much for my goods,' and somebody believes him (and buys them). The Prophet (ﷺ) then recited: \"Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's Covenant and their oaths.\" (3.77)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":42,"hadith":7}}]}
