I requested him to give me respite for repaying but he refused. I requested Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to intercede with the Jew. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went to the Jew and asked him to accept the fruits of my trees in place of the debt but the Jew refused. Allah's Apostle entered the garden of the date-palms, wandering among the trees and ordered me (saying), \"Pluck (the fruits) and give him his due.\" So, I plucked the fruits for him after the departure of Allah's Apostle and gave his thirty Awsuq, and still had seventeen Awsuq extra for myself. Jabir said: I went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to inform of what had happened, but found him praying the `Asr prayer. After the prayer I told him about the extra fruits which remained. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) told me to inform (`Umar) Ibn Al-Khattab about it. When I went to `Umar and told him about it, `Umar said, \"When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) walked in your garden, I was sure that Allah would definitely bless it","grades":[],"reference":{"book":43,"hadith":12}}]}
