			"text": "Narrated `Abdullah bin Mas`ud:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Whoever takes a false oath so as to take the property of a Muslim (illegally) will meet Allah while He will be angry with him.\" Al-Ash'ath said: By Allah, that saying concerned me. I had common land with a Jew, and the Jew later on denied my ownership, so I took him to the Prophet who asked me whether I had a proof of my ownership. When I replied in the negative, the Prophet asked the Jew to take an oath. I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! He will take an oath and deprive me of my property.\" So, Allah revealed the following verse: \"Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's covenant and their oaths.\" (3.77)",
