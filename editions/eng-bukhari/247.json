La Malja'a wa la manja minka illa ilaika. Allahumma amantu bikitabika-l-ladhi anzalta wa bina-biyika-l ladhi arsalta\" (O Allah! I surrender to You and entrust all my affairs to You and depend upon You for Your Blessings both with hope and fear of You. There is no fleeing from You, and there is no place of protection and safety except with You O Allah! I believe in Your Book (the Qur'an) which You have revealed and in Your Prophet (Muhammad) whom You have sent).

Let the aforesaid words be your last utterance (before sleep).\" I repeated it before the Prophet (ﷺ) and when I reached \"Allahumma amantu bikitabika-l-ladhi anzalta (O Allah I believe in Your Book which You have revealed).\" I said, \"Wa-rasulika (and your Apostle).\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"No, (but say): 'Wanabiyika-l-ladhi arsalta (Your Prophet whom You have sent), instead",
