He said (to himself) whether he should continue the prayer or reply to his mother. She came to him the second time and called him and said, \"O Allah! Do not let him die until he sees the faces of prostitutes.\" Juraij used to live in a hermitage. A woman said that she would entice Juraij, so she went to him and presented herself (for an evil act) but he refused. She then went to a shepherd and allowed him to commit an illegal sexual intercourse with her and later she gave birth to a boy. She alleged that the baby was from Juraij. The people went to Juraij and broke down his hermitage, pulled him out of it and abused him. He performed ablution and offered the prayer, then he went to the male (baby) and asked him; \"O boy! Who is your father?\" The baby replied that his father was the shepherd. The people said that they would build for him a hermitage of gold but Juraij asked them to make it of mud only","grades":[],"reference":{"book":46,"hadith":43}}]}
