On that he said, \"He has told the truth. This verse was revealed about me. I had some dispute with another man regarding a well and we took the case before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said (to me), \"Produce two witnesses (to support your claim); otherwise the defendant has the right to take an oath (to refute your claim).' I said, 'The defendant would not mind to take a false oath.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said, 'Whoever took a false oath in order to grab someone else's property will meet Allah, Allah will be angry with him.' Allah then revealed what Confirmed it.\" Al-Ash'ath then recited the following Verse:--\"Verily! Those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah's covenant, And their oaths . . .
