Ibn `Umar used to say in such a case, \"The manumitted should manumit the slave completely if he has sufficient money to pay the rest of the price of that slave (which is to be justly estimated) and the other shareholders are to take the price of their shares and the slave is freed (released from slavery).\" Ibn `Umar narrated this verdict from the Prophet",
