The sons of `Utba stipulated that my Wala' should be for them.\" `Aisha said, \"Barirah came to me and she was given the writing of emancipation by her masters and she asked me to buy and manumit her. I agreed to it, but Barirah told me that her masters would not sell her unless her Wala' was for them.\" `Aisha said, \"I am not in need of that.\" When the Prophet (ﷺ) heard that, or he was told about it, he asked `Aisha about it. `Aisha mentioned what Barirah had told her. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Buy and manumit (free) her and let them stipulate whatever they like.\" So, `Aisha bought and manumitted her and her masters stipulated that her Wala' should be for them.\" The Prophet;, said, \"The Wala' will be for the liberator even if they stipulated a hundred conditions",
