			"text": "Narrated `Urwa from `Aisha:The wives of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) were in two groups. One group consisted of `Aisha, Hafsa, Safiyya and Sauda; and the other group consisted of Um Salama and the other wives of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). The Muslims knew that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) loved `Aisha, so if any of them had a gift and wished to give to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), he would delay it, till Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had come to `Aisha's home and then he would send his gift to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in her home. The group of Um Salama discussed the matter together and decided that Um Salama should request Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to tell the people to send their gifts to him in whatever wife's house he was. Um Salama told Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) of what they had said, but he did not reply. Then they (those wives) asked Um Salama about it. She said, \"He did not say anything to me.\" They asked her to talk to him again. She talked to him again when she met him on her day, but he gave no reply. When they asked her, she replied that he had given no reply. They said to her, \"Talk to him till he gives you a reply.\" When it was her turn, she talked to him again. He then said to her, \"Do not hurt me regarding Aisha, as the Divine Inspirations do not come to me on any of the beds except that of Aisha.\" On that Um Salama said, \"I repent to Allah for hurting you.\" Then the group of Um Salama called Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and sent her to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to say to him, \"Your wives request to treat them and the daughter of Abu Bakr on equal terms.\" Then Fatima conveyed the message to him. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"O my daughter! Don't you love whom I love?\" She replied in the affirmative and returned and told them of the situation. They requested her to go to him again but she refused. They then sent Zainab bint Jahsh who went to him and used harsh words saying, \"Your wives request you to treat them and the daughter of Ibn Abu Quhafa on equal terms.\" On that she raised her voice and abused `Aisha to her face so much so that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) looked at `Aisha to see whether she would retort. `Aisha started replying to Zainab till she silenced her. The Prophet (ﷺ) then looked at `Aisha and said, \"She is really the daughter of Abu Bakr",
