The camel used to go ahead of the Prophet, so Ibn `Umar's father would say, \"O `Abdullah! No one should go ahead of the Prophet.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, \"Sell it to me.\" `Umar said to the Prophet \"It is for you.\" So, he bought it and said, \"O `Abdullah! It is for you, and you can do with it what you like",
