The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"This is worn by the one who will have no share in the Hereafter.\" Later on Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got some silken cloaks similar to that one, and he sent one to `Umar. `Umar said to the Prophet (ﷺ) \"How can I wear it, while you said about it what you said?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I have not given it to you to wear, but to sell or to give to someone else.\" So, `Umar sent it to his brother at Mecca before he embraced Islam",
