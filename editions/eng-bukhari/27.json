I asked, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Why have you left that person? By Allah I regard him as a faithful believer.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) commented: \"Or merely a Muslim.\" I remained quiet for a while, but could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. And then asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), \"Why have you left so and so? By Allah! He is a faithful believer.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) again said, \"Or merely a Muslim.\" And I could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"O Sa'd! I give to a person while another is dearer to me, for fear that he might be thrown on his face in the Fire by Allah",
