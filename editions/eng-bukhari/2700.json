The Prophet (ﷺ) would return to them any person from Al-Mushrikun (polytheists, idolaters, pagans). 2. Al-Mushrikun pagans would not return any of the Muslims going to them, and 3. The Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions would come to Makkah the following year and would stay there for three days and would enter with their weapons in cases, e.g., swords, arrows, bows, etc. Abu Jandal came hopping, his legs being chained, but the Prophet (ﷺ) returned him to Al-Mushrikun",
