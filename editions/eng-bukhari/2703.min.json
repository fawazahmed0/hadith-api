No, by Him Who has sent you with the Truth, her tooth will not be broken.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"O Anas! Allah\"; law ordains retaliation.\" Later the relatives of the girl agreed and forgave her. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"There are some of Allah's slaves who, if they take an oath by Allah, are responded to by Allah i.e. their oath is fulfilled). Anas added, \"The people agreed and accepted the Irsh","grades":[],"reference":{"book":53,"hadith":13}}]}
