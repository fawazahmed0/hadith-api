Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to Az-Zubair, \"O Zubair! Irrigate (your garden) first, and then let the water flow to your neighbor.\" The Ansari became angry and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Is it because he is your cousin?\" On that the complexion of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) changed (because of anger) and said (to Az-Zubair), \"I irrigate (your garden) and then withhold the water till it reaches the walls (surrounding the palms).\" So, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave Az-Zubair his full right. Before that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had given a generous judgment beneficial for Az-Zubair and the Ansari, but when the Ansan irritated Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) he gave Az-Zubair his full right according to the evident law. Az-Zubair said, \"By Allah ! I think the following Verse was revealed concerning that case: \"But no by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between them.\" (4.65)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":53,"hadith":18}}]}
