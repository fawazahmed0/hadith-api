The people told me that it was obligatory that my son should be stoned to death, so in lieu of that I ransomed my son by paying one hundred sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the religious scholars about it, and they informed me that my son must be lashed one hundred lashes, and be exiled for one year, and the wife of this (man) must be stoned to death.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, I will judge between you according to Allah's Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to be returned to you, your son is to receive a hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. You, Unais, go to the wife of this (man) and if she confesses her guilt, stone her to death.\" Unais went to that woman next morning and she confessed. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered that she be stoned to death","grades":[],"reference":{"book":54,"hadith":13}}]}
