			"text": "Narrated Ibn `Umar:When the people of Khaibar dislocated `Abdullah bin `Umar's hands and feet, `Umar got up delivering a sermon saying, \"No doubt, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) made a contract with the Jews concerning their properties, and said to them, 'We allow you (to stand in your land) as long as Allah allows you.' Now `Abdullah bin `Umar went to his land and was attacked at night, and his hands and feet were dislocated, and as we have no enemies there except those Jews, they are our enemies and the only people whom we suspect, I have made up my mind to exile them.\" When `Umar decided to carry out his decision, a son of Abu Al-Haqiq's came and addressed `Umar, \"O chief of the believers, will you exile us although Muhammad allowed us to stay at our places, and made a contract with us about our properties, and accepted the condition of our residence in our land?\" `Umar said, \"Do you think that I have forgotten the statement of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), i.e.: What will your condition be when you are expelled from Khaibar and your camel will be carrying you night after night?\" The Jew replied, \"That was joke from Abul-Qasim.\" `Umar said, \"O the enemy of Allah! You are telling a lie.\" `Umar then drove them out and paid them the price of their properties in the form of fruits, money, camel saddles and ropes, etc",
