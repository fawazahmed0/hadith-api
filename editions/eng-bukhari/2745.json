This is my brother's son whom my brother entrusted to me.\" Then 'Abu bin Zam`a got up and said, \"This is my brother and the son of the slave-girl of my father.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"O Abu bin Zam`a! This boy is for you as the boy belongs to the bed (where he was born), and for the adulterer is the stone (i.e. deprivation).\" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said to his wife Sauda bint Zam`a, \"Screen yourself from this boy,\" when he saw the boy's resemblance to `Utba. Since then the boy did not see Sauda till he died",
