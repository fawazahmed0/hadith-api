Allah, the Blessed, the Superior stated in His book: 'By no means shall you attain Birr, unless you spend of that which you love....' (V 3:92) and the most beloved property to me is Bairuha' (which was a garden where Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to go to sit in its shade and drink from its water). I gave it to the Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ) hoping for Allah's Reward in the Hereafter. So, Ao Allah's Messenger ! Use it as Allah orders you to use it.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Bravo! O Abu Talha, it is fruitful property. We have accepted it from you and now we return it to you. Distribute it amongst you relatives.\" So, Abu Talha distributed it amongst his relatives, amongst whom were Ubai and Hassan. When Hassan sold his share of that garden to Mu'awiyya, he was asked, \"How do you see Abu Talha's Sadaqa?\" He replied, \"Who should not I sell a Sa' of date for Sa' of money ?\" The garden was situated on the courtyard of the palace of Bani Jadila built by Mu'awiya",
