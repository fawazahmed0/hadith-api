So what do you advise me regarding it?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"If you wish you can keep it as an endowment to be used for charitable purposes.\" So, `Umar gave the land in charity (i.e. as an endowments on the condition that the land would neither be sold nor given as a present, nor bequeathed, (and its yield) would be used for the poor, the kinsmen, the emancipation of slaves, Jihad, and for guests and travelers; and its administrator could eat in a reasonable just manner, and he also could feed his friends without intending to be wealthy by its means",
