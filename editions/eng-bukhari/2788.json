Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), once visited her and she provided him with food and started looking for lice in his head. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) slept, and afterwards woke up smiling. Umm Haram asked, \"What causes you to smile, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?\" He said. \"Some of my followers who (in a dream) were presented before me as fighters in Allah's cause (on board a ship) amidst this sea caused me to smile; they were as kings on the thrones (or like kings on the thrones).\" (Ishaq, a sub-narrator is not sure as to which expression the Prophet (ﷺ) used.) Umm Haram said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Invoke Allah that he makes me one of them. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) invoked Allah for her and slept again and woke up smiling. Once again Umm Haram asked, \"What makes you smile, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?\" He replied, \"Some of my followers were presented to me as fighters in Allah's Cause,\" repeating the same dream. Umm Haram said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Invoke Allah that He makes me one of them.\" He said, \"You are amongst the first ones.\" It happened that she sailed on the sea during the Caliphate of Mu'awiya bin Abi Sufyan, and after she disembarked, she fell down from her riding animal and died",
