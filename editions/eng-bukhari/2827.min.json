A Wabr (i.e. guinea pig) who has come down to us from the mountain of Qaduim (i.e. grazing place of sheep) blames me for killing a Muslim who was given superiority by Allah because of me, and Allah did not disgrace me at his hands (i.e. was not killed as an infidel).\" (The sub-narrator said \"I do not know whether the Prophet (ﷺ) gave him a share or not","grades":[],"reference":{"book":56,"hadith":43}}]}
