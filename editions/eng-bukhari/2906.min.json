It was the day of `Id when negroes used to play with leather shields and spears. Either I requested Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) or he himself asked me whether I would like to see the display. I replied in the affirmative. Then he let me stand behind him and my cheek was touching his cheek and he was saying, \"Carry on, O Bani Arfida (i.e. negroes)!\" When I got tired, he asked me if that was enough. I replied in the affirmative and he told me to leave","grades":[],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":0}}]}
