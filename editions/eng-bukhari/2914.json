The latter were in a state of Ihram, while he was not. He saw an onager and rode his horse and requested his companions to give him his lash but they refused. Then he asked them to give him his spear but they refused, so he took it himself, attacked the onager, and killed it. Some of the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) ate of it while some others refused to eat. When they caught up with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) they asked him about that, and he said, \"That was a meal Allah fed you with.\" (It is also said that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, \"Have you got something of its meat?",
