So, when the day dawned, the Jews came out with their bags and spades. When they saw the Prophet; they said, \"Muhammad and his army!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, Allahu--Akbar! (Allah is Greater) and Khaibar is ruined, for whenever we approach a nation (i.e. enemy to fight) then it will be a miserable morning for those who have been warned",
