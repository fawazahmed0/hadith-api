Then we began to eat a single date each per day.\" A man asked (Jabir), \"O Abu `Abdullah! How could a person be satisfied with a single date?\" Jabir replied, \"We realized the value of that one date when we could not even have that much till we reached the sea-shore, when all of a sudden we saw a huge fish cast by the sea.
