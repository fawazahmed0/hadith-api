Do you like me to kill him?\" He replied in the affirmative. So, Muhammad bin Maslama went to him (i.e. Ka`b) and said, \"This person (i.e. the Prophet) has put us to task and asked us for charity.\" Ka`b replied, \"By Allah, you will get tired of him.\" Muhammad said to him, \"We have followed him, so we dislike to leave him till we see the end of his affair.\" Muhammad bin Maslama went on talking to him in this way till he got the chance to kill him",
