He instructed them, \"Stick to your place, and don't leave it even if you see birds snatching us, till I send for you; and if you see that we have defeated the infidels and made them flee, even then you should not leave your place till I send for you.\" Then the infidels were defeated. By Allah, I saw the women fleeing lifting up their clothes revealing their leg-bangles and their legs. So, the companions of `Abdullah bin Jubair said, \"The booty! O people, the booty ! Your companions have become victorious, what are you waiting for now?\" `Abdullah bin Jubair said, \"Have you forgotten what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to you?\" They replied, \"By Allah! We will go to the people (i.e. the enemy) and collect our share from the war booty.\" But when they went to them, they were forced to turn back defeated. At that time Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in their rear was calling them back. Only twelve men remained with the Prophet (ﷺ) and the infidels martyred seventy men from us. On the day (of the battle) of Badr, the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions had caused the 'Pagans to lose 140 men, seventy of whom were captured and seventy were killed. Then Abu Sufyan asked thrice, \"Is Muhammad present amongst these people?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered his companions not to answer him. Then he asked thrice, \"Is the son of Abu Quhafa present amongst these people?\" He asked again thrice, \"Is the son of Al-Khattab present amongst these people?\" He then returned to his companions and said, \"As for these (men), they have been killed.\" `Umar could not control himself and said (to Abu Sufyan), \"You told a lie, by Allah! O enemy of Allah! All those you have mentioned are alive, and the thing which will make you unhappy is still there.\" Abu Sufyan said, \"Our victory today is a counterbalance to yours in the battle of Badr, and in war (the victory) is always undecided and is shared in turns by the belligerents, and you will find some of your (killed) men mutilated, but I did not urge my men to do so, yet I do not feel sorry for their deed\" After that he started reciting cheerfully, \"O Hubal, be high! (1) On that the Prophet (ﷺ) said (to his companions), \"Why don't you answer him back?\" They said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) What shall we say?\" He said, \"Say, Allah is Higher and more Sublime.\" (Then) Abu Sufyan said, \"We have the (idol) Al `Uzza, and you have no `Uzza.\" The Prophet said (to his companions), \"Why don't you answer him back?\" They asked, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What shall we say?\" He said, \"Says Allah is our Helper and you have no helper","grades":[],"reference":{"book":56,"hadith":245}}]}
