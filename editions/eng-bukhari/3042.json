Did you flee on the day (of the battle) of Hunain?\" Al-Bara replied while I was listening, \"As for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) he did not flee on that day. Abu Sufyan bin Al- Harith was holding the reins of his mule and when the pagans attacked him, he dismounted and started saying, 'I am the Prophet, and there is no lie about it; I am the son of `Abdul Muttalib.' On that day nobody was seen braver than the Prophet",
