The Prophet (ﷺ) supported them with seventy men from the Ansar whom we used to call Al-Qurra'(i.e. Scholars) who (out of piety) used to cut wood during the day and pray all the night. So, those people took the (seventy) men till they reached a place called Bi'r-Ma'ana where they betrayed and martyred them. So, the Prophet (ﷺ) invoked evil on the tribe of Ril, Dhakwan and Bani Lihyan for one month in the prayer. Narrated Qatada: Anas told us that they (i.e. Muslims) used to recite a Quranic Verse concerning those martyrs which was:-- \"O Allah! Let our people be informed on our behalf that we have met our Lord Who has got pleased with us and made us pleased.\" Then the Verse was cancelled","grades":[],"reference":{"book":56,"hadith":269}}]}
