			"text": "Narrated Abaya bin Rifaa:My grandfather, Rafi` said, \"We were in the company of the Prophet (ﷺ) at DhulHulaifa, and the people suffered from hunger. We got some camels and sheep (as booty) and the Prophet (ﷺ) was still behind the people. They hurried and put the cooking pots on the fire. (When he came) he ordered that the cooking pots should be upset and then he distributed the booty (amongst the people) regarding ten sheep as equal to one camel then a camel fled and the people chased it till they got tired, as they had a few horses (for chasing it). So a man threw an arrow at it and caused it to stop (with Allah's Permission). On that the Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Some of these animals behave like wild beasts, so, if any animal flee from you, deal with it in the same way.\" My grandfather asked (the Prophet (ﷺ) ), \"We hope (or are afraid) that we may meet the enemy tomorrow and we have no knives. Can we slaughter our animals with canes?\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, \"If the instrument used for killing causes the animal to bleed profusely and if Allah's Name is mentioned on killing it, then eat its meat (i.e. it is lawful) but won't use a tooth or a nail and I am telling you the reason: A tooth is a bone (and slaughtering with a bone is forbidden ), and a nail is the slaughtering instrument of the Ethiopians",
