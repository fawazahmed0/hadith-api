During the journey, the she-camel slipped and both the Prophet (ﷺ) and (his) wife fell down. Abu Talha (the sub-narrator thinks that Anas said that Abu Talha jumped from his camel quickly) said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! May Allah sacrifice me for your sake! Did you get hurt?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied,\"No, but take care of the lady.\" Abu Talha covered his face with his garment and proceeded towards her and covered her with his garment, and she got up. He then set right the condition of their she-camel and both of them (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) and his wife) rode and proceeded till they approached Medina. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"We are returning with repentance and worshipping and praising our Lord.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) kept on saying this statement till he entered Medina","grades":[],"reference":{"book":56,"hadith":290}}]}
