Today one will be killed either as an oppressor or as an oppressed one. I see that I will be killed as an oppressed one. My biggest worry is my debts. Do you think, if we pay the debts, there will be something left for us from our money?\" Az-Zubair added, \"O my son! Sell our property and pay my debts.\" Az-Zubair then willed one-third of his property and willed one-third of that portion to his sons; namely, `Abdullah's sons. He said, \"One-third of the one third. If any property is left after the payment of the debts, one-third (of the one-third of what is left) is to be given to your sons.\" (Hisham, a sub-narrator added, \"Some of the sons of `Abdullah were equal in age to the sons of Az-Zubair e.g. Khubaib and `Abbas. `Abdullah had nine sons and nine daughters at that time.\" (The narrator `Abdullah added:) My father (Az-Zubair) went on drawing my attention to his debts saying, \"If you should fail to pay part of the debts, appeal to my Master to help you.\" By Allah! I could not understand what he meant till I asked, \"O father! Who is your Master?\" He replied, \"Allah (is my Master).\" By Allah, whenever I had any difficulty regarding his debts, I would say, \"Master of Az-Zubair! Pay his debts on his behalf .\" and Allah would (help me to) pay it. Az-Zubair was martyred leaving no Dinar or Dirham but two pieces of land, one of which was (called) Al-Ghaba, and eleven houses in Medina, two in Basra, one in Kufa and one in Egypt. In fact, the source of the debt which he owed was, that if somebody brought some money to deposit with him. Az-Zubair would say, \"No, (i won't keep it as a trust), but I take it as a debt, for I am afraid it might be lost.\" Az-Zubair was never appointed governor or collector of the tax of Kharaj or any other similar thing, but he collected his wealth (from the war booty he gained) during the holy battles he took part in, in the company of the Prophet, Abu Bakr, `Umar, and `Uthman. (`Abdullah bin Az-Zubair added:) When I counted his debt, it turned to be two million and two hundred thousand. (The sub-narrator added:) Hakim bin Hizam met `Abdullah bin Zubair and asked, \"O my nephew! How much is the debt of my brother?\" `Abdullah kept it as a secret and said, \"One hundred thousand,\" Hakim said, \"By Allah! I don't think your property will cover it.\" On that `Abdullah said to him, \"What if it is two million and two hundred thousand?\" Hakim said, \"I don't think you can pay it; so if you are unable to pay all of it, I will help you.\" Az- Zubair had already bought Al-Ghaba for one hundred and seventy thousand. `Abdullah sold it for one million and six hundred thousand. Then he called the people saying, \"Any person who has any money claim on Az-Zubair should come to us in Al-Ghaba.\" There came to him `Abdullah bin Ja`far whom Az-Zubair owed four hundred thousand. He said to `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair, \"If you wish I will forgive you the debt.\" `Abdullah (bin Az-Zubair) said, \"No.\" Then Ibn Ja`far said, \"If you wish you can defer the payment if you should defer the payment of any debt.\" Ibn Az-Zubair said, \"No.\" `Abdullah bin Ja`far said, \"Give me a piece of the land.\" `Abdullah bin AzZubair said (to him), \"Yours is the land extending from this place to this place.\" So, `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair sold some of the property (including the houses) and paid his debt perfectly, retaining four and a half shares from the land (i.e. Al-Ghaba). He then went to Mu'awlya while `Amr bin `Uthman, Al-Mundhir bin Az- Zubair and Ibn Zam`a were sitting with him. Mu'awiya asked, \"At what price have you appraised Al- Ghaba?\" He said, \"One hundred thousand for each share,\" Muawiya asked, \"How many shares have been left?\" `Abdullah replied, \"Four and a half shares.\" Al-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair said, \"I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.\" `Amr bin `Uthman said, \"I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.\" Ibn Zam`a said, \"I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.\" Muawiya said, \"How much is left now?\" `Abdullah replied, \"One share and a half.\" Muawiya said, \"I would like to buy it for one hundred and fifty thousand.\" `Abdullah also sold his part to Muawiya six hundred thousand. When Ibn AzZubair had paid all the debts. Az-Zubair's sons said to him, \"Distribute our inheritance among us.\" He said, \"No, by Allah, I will not distribute it among you till I announce in four successive Hajj seasons, 'Would those who have money claims on Az-Zubair come so that we may pay them their debt.\" So, he started to announce that in public in every Hajj season, and when four years had elapsed, he distributed the inheritance among the inheritors. Az-Zubair had four wives, and after the one-third of his property was excluded (according to the will), each of his wives received one million and two hundred thousand. So the total amount of his property was fifty million and two hundred thousand","grades":[],"reference":{"book":57,"hadith":38}}]}
