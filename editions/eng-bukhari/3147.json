			"text": "Narrated Anas bin Malik:When Allah favored His Apostle with the properties of Hawazin tribe as Fai (booty), he started giving to some Quarries men even up to one-hundred camels each, whereupon some Ansari men said about Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), \"May Allah forgive His Apostle! He is giving to (men of) Quraish and leaves us, in spite of the fact that our swords are still dropping blood (of the infidels)\" When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was informed of what they had said, he called the Ansar and gathered them in a leather tent and did not call anybody else along, with them. When they gathered, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to them and said, \"What is the statement which, I have been informed, and that which you have said?\" The learned ones among them replied,\" O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! The wise ones amongst us did not say anything, but the youngsters amongst us said, 'May Allah forgive His Apostle; he gives the Quarish and leaves the Ansar, in spite of the fact that our swords are still dribbling (wet) with the blood of the infidels.' \" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, I give to such people as are still close to the period of Infidelity (i.e. they have recently embraced Islam and Faith is still weak in their hearts). Won't you be pleased to see people go with fortune, while you return with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to your houses? By Allah, what you will return with, is better than what they are returning with.\" The Ansar replied, \"Yes, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), we are satisfied' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said to them.\" You will find after me, others being preferred to you. Then be patient till you meet Allah and meet His Apostle at Al-Kauthar (i.e. a fount in Paradise).\" (Anas added:) But we did not remain patient",
