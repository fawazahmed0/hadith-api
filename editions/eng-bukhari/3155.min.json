We thought that the Prophet (ﷺ) prohibited that because the Khumus had not been taken out of the booty (i.e. donkeys); other people said, \"He prohibited eating them for ever.\" The sub-narrator added, \"I asked Sa`id bin Jubair who said, 'He has made the eating of donkeys' meat illegal for ever","grades":[],"reference":{"book":57,"hadith":63}}]}
