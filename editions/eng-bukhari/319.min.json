Some of us intended to perform `Umra while others Hajj. When we reached Mecca, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Those who had assumed the lhram for `Umra and had not brought the Hadi should finish his lhram and whoever had assumed the Ihram for `Umra and brought the Hadi should not finish the Ihram till he has slaughtered his Hadi and whoever had assumed the lhram for Hajj should complete his Hajj.\" `Aisha further said, \"I got my periods (menses) and kept on menstruating till the day of `Arafat, and I had assumed the Ihram for `Umra only (Tamattu`). The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered me to undo and comb my head hair and assume the lhram for Hajj only and leave the `Umra. I did the same till I completed the Hajj. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) sent `Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me and ordered me to perform `Umra from at-Tan`im in lieu of the missed `Umra","grades":[],"reference":{"book":6,"hadith":24}}]}
