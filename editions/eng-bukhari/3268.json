One day he invoked (Allah) for a long period and then said, \"I feel that Allah has inspired me as how to cure myself. Two persons came to me (in my dream) and sat, one by my head and the other by my feet. One of them asked the other, \"What is the ailment of this man?\" The other replied, 'He has been bewitched\" The first asked, 'Who has bewitched him?' The other replied, 'Lubaid bin Al-A'sam.' The first one asked, 'What material has he used?' The other replied, 'A comb, the hair gathered on it, and the outer skin of the pollen of the male date-palm.' The first asked, 'Where is that?' The other replied, 'It is in the well of Dharwan.' \" So, the Prophet (ﷺ) went out towards the well and then returned and said to me on his return, \"Its date-palms (the date-palms near the well) are like the heads of the devils.\" I asked, \"Did you take out those things with which the magic was worked?\" He said, \"No, for I have been cured by Allah and I am afraid that this action may spread evil amongst the people.\" Later on the well was filled up with earth",
