So the Quraish and the Ansar became angry and said, \"He (i.e. the Prophet, ) gives the chief of Najd and does not give us.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I give them) so as to attract their hearts (to Islam).\" Then a man with sunken eyes, prominent checks, a raised forehead, a thick beard and a shaven head, came (in front of the Prophet (ﷺ) ) and said, \"Be afraid of Allah, O Muhammad!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) ' said \"Who would obey Allah if I disobeyed Him? (Is it fair that) Allah has trusted all the people of the earth to me while, you do not trust me?\" Somebody who, I think was Khalid bin Al-Walid, requested the Prophet (ﷺ) to let him chop that man's head off, but he prevented him. When the man left, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Among the off-spring of this man will be some who will recite the Qur'an but the Qur'an will not reach beyond their throats (i.e. they will recite like parrots and will not understand it nor act on it), and they will renegade from the religion as an arrow goes through the game's body. They will kill the Muslims but will not disturb the idolaters. If I should live up to their time' I will kill them as the people of 'Ad were killed (i.e. I will kill all of them)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":60,"hadith":19}}]}
