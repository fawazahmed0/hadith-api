They used to say: \"This is a great day on which Allah saved Moses and drowned the folk of Pharaoh. Moses observed the fast on this day, as a sign of gratitude to Allah.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I am closer to Moses than they.\" So, he observed the fast (on that day) and ordered the Muslims to fast on it",
