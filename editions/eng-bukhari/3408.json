The Muslim taking an oath, said, \"By Him Who has preferred Muhammad over all people...!\" The Jew said, \"By Him Who has preferred Moses, over all people.\" The Muslim raised his hand and slapped the Jew who came to the Prophet (ﷺ) to tell him what had happened between him and the Muslim. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Don't give me superiority over Moses, for the people will become unconscious (on the Day of Resurrection) and I will be the first to gain consciousness to see Moses standing and holding a side of Allah's Throne. I will not know if he has been among those people who have become unconscious; and that he has gained consciousness before me, or he has been amongst those whom Allah has exempted",
