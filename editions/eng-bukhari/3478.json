			"text": "Narrated Abu Sa`id:The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Amongst the people preceding your age, there was a man whom Allah had given a lot of money. While he was in his death-bed, he called his sons and said, 'What type of father have I been to you? They replied, 'You have been a good father.' He said, 'I have never done a single good deed; so when I die, burn me, crush my body, and scatter the resulting ashes on a windy day.' His sons did accordingly, but Allah gathered his particles and asked (him), 'What made you do so?' He replied, \"Fear of you.' So Allah bestowed His Mercy upon him. (forgave him)",
