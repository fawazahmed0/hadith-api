(`Abdullah) bin AzZubair said, \" `Aisha should be stopped from doing so.\" (When `Aisha heard this), she said protestingly, \"Shall I be stopped from doing so? I vow that I will never talk to `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair.\" On that, Ibn Az-Zubair asked some people from Quraish and particularly the two uncles of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to intercede with her, but she refused (to talk to him). Az-Zuhriyun, the uncles of the Prophet, including `Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin `Abd Yaghuth and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama said to him, \"When we ask for the permission to visit her, enter her house along with us (without taking her leave).\" He did accordingly (and she accepted their intercession). He sent her ten slaves whom she manumitted as an expiation for (not keeping) her vow. `Aisha manumitted more slaves for the same purpose till she manumitted forty slaves. She said, \"I wish I had specified what I would have done in case of not fulfilling my vow when I made the vow, so that I might have done it easily","grades":[],"reference":{"book":61,"hadith":15}}]}
