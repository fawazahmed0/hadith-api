A small pot containing some water was in front of the Prophet (ﷺ) and when he had finished the ablution, the people rushed towards him. He asked, 'What is wrong with you?' They replied, 'We have no water either for performing ablution or for drinking except what is present in front of you.' So he placed his hand in that pot and the water started flowing among his fingers like springs. We all drank and performed ablution (from it).\" I asked Jabir, \"How many were you?\" he replied, \"Even if we had been one-hundred-thousand, it would have been sufficient for us, but we were fifteen-hundred","grades":[],"reference":{"book":61,"hadith":85}}]}
