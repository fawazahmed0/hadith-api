			"text": "Narrated `Abdullah:We used to consider miracles as Allah's Blessings, but you people consider them to be a warning. Once we were with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on a journey, and we ran short of water. He said, \"Bring the water remaining with you.\" The people brought a utensil containing a little water. He placed his hand in it and said, \"Come to the blessed water, and the Blessing is from Allah.\" I saw the water flowing from among the fingers of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) , and no doubt, we heard the meal glorifying Allah, when it was being eaten (by him)",
