The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Welcome, O my daughter!\" Then he made her sit on his right or on his left side, and then he told her a secret and she started weeping. I asked her, \"Why are you weeping?\" He again told her a secret and she started laughing. I said, \"I never saw happiness so near to sadness as I saw today.\" I asked her what the Prophet (ﷺ) had told her. She said, \"I would never disclose the secret of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" When the Prophet (ﷺ) died, I asked her about it. She replied. \"The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Every year Gabriel used to revise the Qur'an with me once only, but this year he has done so twice. I think this portends my death, and you will be the first of my family to follow me.' So I started weeping. Then he said.
