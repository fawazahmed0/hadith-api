He sat on the pulpit, and praising and glorifying Allah, he said, \"Now then, people will increase but the Ansar will decrease in number, so much so that they, compared with the people, will be just like the salt in the meals. So, if any of you should take over the authority by which he can either benefit some people or harm some others, he should accept the goodness of their good people (i.e. Ansar) and excuse the faults of their wrong-doers.\" That was the last gathering which the Prophet (ﷺ) attended","grades":[],"reference":{"book":61,"hadith":132}}]}
