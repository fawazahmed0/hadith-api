The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Has every one of you two garments?\" A man put a similar question to `Umar on which he replied, \"When Allah makes you wealthier then you should clothe yourself properly during prayers. Otherwise one can pray with an Izar and a Rida' (a sheet covering the upper part of the body.) Izar and a shirt, Izar and a Qaba', trousers and a Rida, trousers and a shirt or trousers and a Qaba', Tubban and a Qaba' or Tubban and a shirt.\" (The narrator added, \"I think that he also said a Tubban and a Rida)",
