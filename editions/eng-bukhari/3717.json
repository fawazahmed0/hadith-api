			"text": "Narrated Marwan bin Al-Hakam:`Uthman bin `Affan was afflicted with severe nose-bleeding in the year when such illness was prevelant and that prevented him from performing Hajj, and (because of it) he made his will. A man from Quraish came to him and said, \"Appoint your successor.\" `Uthman asked, \"Did the people name him? (i.e. the successor) the man said, \"Yes.\" `Uthman asked, \"Who is that?\" The man remained silent. Another man came to `Uthman and I think it was Al-Harith. He also said, \"Appoint your successor.\" `Uthman asked, \"Did the people name him?\" The man replied \"Yes.\" `Uthman said, \"Who is that?\" The man remained silent. `Uthman said, \"Perhaps they have mentioned Az-Zubair?\" The man said, \"Yes.\" `Uthman said, \"By Him in Whose Hands my life is, he is the best of them as I know, and the dearest of them to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)",
