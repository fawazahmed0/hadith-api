Fatima heard of this and went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, \"Your people think that you do not become angry for the sake of your daughters as `Ali is now going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl. \"On that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up and after his recitation of Tashah-hud. I heard him saying, \"Then after! I married one of my daughters to Abu Al-`As bin Al- Rabi` (the husband of Zainab, the daughter of the Prophet (ﷺ) ) before Islam and he proved truthful in whatever he said to me. No doubt, Fatima is a part of me, I hate to see her being troubled. By Allah, the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the daughter of Allah's Enemy cannot be the wives of one man.\" So `Ali gave up that engagement. 'Al-Miswar further said: I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) talking and he mentioned a son-in-law of his belonging to the tribe of Bani `Abd-Shams. He highly praised him concerning that relationship and said (whenever) he spoke to me, he spoke the truth, and whenever he promised me, he fulfilled his promise","grades":[],"reference":{"book":62,"hadith":76}}]}
