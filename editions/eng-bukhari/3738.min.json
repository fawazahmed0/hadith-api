Once I wished to see a dream and narrate it to the Prophet (ﷺ) I was young, unmarried, and used to sleep in the Mosque during the lifetime of the Prophet. I dreamt that two angels took me and went away with me towards the (Hell) Fire which looked like a well with the inside walls built up, and had two side-walls like those of a well. There I saw some people in it whom I knew. I started saying, \"I seek Refuge with Allah from the (Hell) Fire, I seek Refuge with Allah from the (Hell) Fire.\" Then another angel met the other two and said to me, \"Do not be afraid.\" I narrated my dream to Hafsa who, in her turn, narrated it to the Prophet. He said, \"What an excellent man `Abdullah is if he only observes the night prayer.\" (Salem, a sub-narrator said, \"Abdullah used not to sleep at night but very little hence forward)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":0}}]}
