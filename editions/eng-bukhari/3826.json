			"text": "Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar: The Prophet (ﷺ) met Zaid bin 'Amr bin Nufail in the bottom of (the valley of) Baldah before any Divine Inspiration came to the Prophet. A meal was presented to the Prophet (ﷺ) but he refused to eat from it. (Then it was presented to Zaid) who said, \"I do not eat anything which you slaughter in the name of your stone idols. I eat none but those things on which Allah's Name has been mentioned at the time of slaughtering.\" Zaid bin 'Amr used to criticize the way Quraish used to slaughter their animals, and used to say, \"Allah has created the sheep and He has sent the water for it from the sky, and He has grown the grass for it from the earth; yet you slaughter it in other than the Name of Allah. He used to say so, for he rejected that practice and considered it as something abominable",
