She used to visit us and talk to us, and when she finished her talk, she used to say: \"The day of the scarf was one of our Lord's wonders: Verily! He has delivered me from the land of Kufr.\" When she said the above verse many times, I (i.e. `Aisha) asked her, \"What was the day of the scarf?\" She replied, \"Once the daughter of some of my masters went out and she was wearing a leather scarf (round her neck) and the leather scarf fell from her and a kite descended and picked it up, mistaking it for a piece of meat. They (i.e. my masters) accused me of stealing it and they tortured me to such an extent that they even looked for it in my private parts. So, while they all were around me, and I was in my great distress, suddenly the kite came over our heads and threw the scarf, and they took it. I said to them 'This is what you accused me of stealing, though I was innocent","grades":[],"reference":{"book":63,"hadith":60}}]}
