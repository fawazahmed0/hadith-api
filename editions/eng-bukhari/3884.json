Say: None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, an expression I will defend your case with, before Allah.\" Abu Jahl and `Abdullah bin Umaiya said, \"O Abu Talib! Will you leave the religion of `Abdul Muttalib?\" So they kept on saying this to him so that the last statement he said to them (before he died) was: \"I am on the religion of `Abdul Muttalib.\" Then the Prophet said, \" I will keep on asking for Allah's Forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden to do so.\" Then the following Verse was revealed:-- \"It is not fitting for the Prophet (ﷺ) and the believers to ask Allah's Forgiveness for the pagans, even if they were their near relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire.\" (9.113) The other Verse was also revealed:-- \"(O Prophet!) Verily, you guide not whom you like, but Allah guides whom He will .......\" (28.56)",
