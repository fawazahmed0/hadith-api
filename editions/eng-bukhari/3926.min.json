O Bilal, how do you feel?\" Whenever Abu Bakr's fever got worse, he would say, \"Every man will meet his death once in one morning while he will be among his family, for death is really nearer to him than his leather shoe laces (to his feet).\" And whenever fever deserted Bilal, he would say aloud, \"Would that I know whether I shall spend a night in the valley (of Mecca) with Idhkhir and Jalil (i.e. kinds of grass) around me, and whether I shall drink one day the water of Mijannah, and whether I shall see once again the hills of Shamah and Tafil?\" Then I went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and told him of that. He said, \"O Allah, make us love Medina as much as or more than we used to love Mecca, O Allah, make it healthy and bless its Sa' and Mud (i.e. measures), and take away its fever to Al-Juhfa","grades":[],"reference":{"book":63,"hadith":151}}]}
