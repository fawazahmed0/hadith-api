Then the Prophet (ﷺ) came to us and I (addressing the dead body) said, \"O Abu As-Sa'ib, may Allah's Mercy be on you! I bear witness that Allah has honored you.\" On that the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"How do you know that Allah has honored him?\" I replied, \"I do not know.

By Allah, though I am the Apostle of Allah, yet I do not know what Allah will do to me,\" By Allah, I will never assert the piety of anyone after him.
