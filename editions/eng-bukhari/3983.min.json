We said (to her),\"(Give us) the letter.\" She said, \"I have no letter.\" Then we made her camel kneel down and we searched her, but we found no letter. Then we said, \"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had not told us a lie, certainly. Take out the letter, otherwise we will strip you naked.\" When she saw that we were determined, she put her hand below her waist belt, for she had tied her cloak round her waist, and she took out the letter, and we brought her to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) Then `Umar said, \"O Allah's Apostle! (This Hatib) has betrayed Allah, His Apostle and the believers! Let me cut off his neck!\" The Prophet asked Hatib, \"What made you do this?\" Hatib said, \"By Allah, I did not intend to give up my belief in Allah and His Apostle but I wanted to have some influence among the (Mecca) people so that through it, Allah might protect my family and property. There is none of your companions but has some of his relatives there through whom Allah protects his family and property.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"He has spoken the truth; do no say to him but good.\" `Umar said, \"He as betrayed Allah, His Apostle and the faithful believers. Let me cut off his neck!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Is he not one of the Badr warriors? May be Allah looked at the Badr warriors and said, 'Do whatever you like, as I have granted Paradise to you, or said, 'I have forgiven you.\"' On this, tears came out of `Umar's eyes, and he said, \"Allah and His Apostle know better","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":34}}]}
