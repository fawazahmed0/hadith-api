Then one of them asked me secretly so that his companion may not hear, \"O Uncle! Show me Abu Jahl.\" I said, \"O nephew! What will you do to him?\" He said, \"I have promised Allah that if I see him (i.e. Abu Jahl), I will either kill him or be killed before I kill him.\" Then the other said the same to me secretly so that his companion should not hear. I would not have been pleased to be in between two other men instead of them. Then I pointed him (i.e. Abu Jahl) out to them. Both of them attacked him like two hawks till they knocked him down. Those two boys were the sons of 'Afra' (i.e. an Ansari woman)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":39}}]}
