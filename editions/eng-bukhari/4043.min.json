The Muslims started saying, \"The booty, the booty!\" `Abdullah bin Jubair said, \"The Prophet (ﷺ) had taken a firm promise from me not to leave this place.\" But his companions refused (to stay). So when they refused (to stay there), (Allah) confused them so that they could not know where to go, and they suffered seventy casualties. Abu Sufyan ascended a high place and said, \"Is Muhammad present amongst the people?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Do not answer him.\" Abu Sufyan said, \"Is the son of Abu Quhafa present among the people?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Do not answer him.\" `Abu Sufyan said, \"Is the son of Al-Khattab amongst the people?\" He then added, \"All these people have been killed, for, were they alive, they would have replied.\" On that, `Umar could not help saying, \"You are a liar, O enemy of Allah! Allah has kept what will make you unhappy.\" Abu Sufyan said, \"Superior may be Hubal!\" On that the Prophet said (to his companions), \"Reply to him.\" They asked, \"What may we say?\" He said, \"Say: Allah is More Elevated and More Majestic!\" Abu Sufyan said, \"We have (the idol) Al-`Uzza, whereas you have no `Uzza!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to his companions), \"Reply to him.\" They said, \"What may we say?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Say: Allah is our Helper and you have no helper.\" Abu Sufyan said, \"(This) day compensates for our loss at Badr and (in) the battle (the victory) is always undecided and shared in turns by the belligerents. You will see some of your dead men mutilated, but neither did I urge this action, nor am I sorry for it.\" Narrated Jabir: Some people took wine in the morning of the day of Uhud and were then killed as martyrs","grades":[],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":0}}]}
