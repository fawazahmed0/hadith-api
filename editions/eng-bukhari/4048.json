			"text": "Narrated Anas: His uncle (Anas bin An-Nadr) was absent from the battle of Badr and he said, \"I was absent from the first battle of the Prophet (i.e. Badr battle), and if Allah should let me participate in (a battle) with the Prophet, Allah will see how strongly I will fight.\" So he encountered the day of Uhud battle. The Muslims fled and he said, \"O Allah ! I appeal to You to excuse me for what these people (i.e. the Muslims) have done, and I am clear from what the pagans have done.\" Then he went forward with his sword and met Sad bin Mu'adh (fleeing), and asked him, \"Where are you going, O Sad? I detect a smell of Paradise before Uhud.\" Then he proceeded on and was martyred. No-body was able to recognize him till his sister recognized him by a mole on his body or by the tips of his fingers. He had over 80 wounds caused by stabbing, striking or shooting with arrows",
