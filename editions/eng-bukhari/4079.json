			"text": "Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to shroud two martyrs of Uhud in one sheet and then say, \"Which of them knew Qur'an more?\" When one of the two was pointed out, he would put him first in the grave. Then he said, \"I will be a witness for them on the Day of Resurrection.\" He ordered them to be buried with their blood (on their bodies). Neither was the funeral prayer offered for them, nor were they washed. Jabir added, \"When my father was martyred, I started weeping and uncovering his face. The companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) stopped me from doing so but the Prophet (ﷺ) did not stop me. Then the Prophet said, '(O Jabir.) don't weep over him, for the angels kept on covering him with their wings till his body was carried away (for burial)",
