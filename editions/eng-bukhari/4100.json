There is no goodness except the goodness of the Hereafter; so please grant Your Blessing to the Ansar and the Emigrants.\" The people used to bring a handful of barley, and a meal used to be prepared thereof by cooking it with a cooking material (i.e. oil, fat and butter having a change in color and smell) and it used to be presented to the people (i.e. workers) who were hungry, and it used to stick to their throats and had a nasty smell",
