Muawiya addressed the people saying, \"'If anybody wants to say anything in this matter of the Caliphate, he should show up and not conceal himself, for we are more rightful to be a Caliph than he and his father.\" On that, Habib bin Masalama said (to Ibn `Umar), \"Why don't you reply to him (i.e. Muawiya)?\" `Abdullah bin `Umar said, \"I untied my garment that was going round my back and legs while I was sitting and was about to say, 'He who fought against you and against your father for the sake of Islam, is more rightful to be a Caliph,' but I was afraid that my statement might produce differences amongst the people and cause bloodshed, and my statement might be interpreted not as I intended.
