My people ordered me to ask the Prophet (ﷺ) to return some or all the date palms they had given to him, but the Prophet (ﷺ) had given those trees to Um Aiman. On that, Um Aiman came and put the garment around my neck and said, \"No, by Him except Whom none has the right to be worshipped, he will not return those trees to you as he (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ) has given them to me.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) go said (to her), \"Return those trees and I will give you so much (instead of them).\" But she kept on refusing, saying, \"No, by Allah,\" till he gave her ten times the number of her date palms",
