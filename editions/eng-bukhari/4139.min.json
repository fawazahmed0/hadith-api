The people dispersed amongst the trees in order to have shade. While we were in this state, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called us and we came and found a bedouin sitting in front of him. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"This (Bedouin) came to me while I was asleep, and he took my sword stealthily. I woke up while he was standing by my head, holding my sword without its sheath. He said, 'Who will save you from me?' I replied, 'Allah.' So he sheathed it (i.e. the sword) and sat down, and here he is.\" But Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not punish him","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":183}}]}
