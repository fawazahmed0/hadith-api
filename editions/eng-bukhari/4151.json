They camped at a well and drew its water till it was dried. When they informed Allah's Apostle of that, he came and sat over its edge and said, \"Bring me a bucket of its water.\" When it was brought, he spat and invoked (Allah) and said, \"Leave it for a while.\" Then they quenched their thirst and watered their riding animals (from that well) till they departed",
