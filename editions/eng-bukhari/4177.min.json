He asked him again (for the third time) but he did not answer him. On that `Umar bin Al-Khattab addressed himself saying, \"May your mother be bereaved of you, O `Umar, for you have asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) thrice, yet he has not answered you.\" `Umar said, \"Then I made my camel run fast and took it in front of the other Muslims, and I was afraid that something might be revealed in my connection. I had hardly waited for a moment when I heard somebody calling me. I said, 'I was afraid that something might have been revealed about me.' Then I came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and greeted him. He (i.e. the Prophet) said, 'Tonight there has been revealed to me, a Sura which is dearer to me than (all the world) on which the sun rises,' and then he recited: 'Verily! We have granted you (O Muhammad) A manifest victory.\" (48.1)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":219}}]}
