The Prophet (ﷺ) proceeded on till he reached (a village called) Ghadir-al-Ashtat. There his spy came and said, \"The Quraish (infidels) have collected a great number of people against you, and they have collected against you the Ethiopians, and they will fight with you, and will stop you from entering the Ka`ba and prevent you.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"O people! Give me your opinion. Do you recommend that I should destroy the families and offspring of those who want to stop us from the Ka`ba? If they should come to us (for peace) then Allah will destroy a spy from the pagans, or otherwise we will leave them in a miserable state.\" On that Abu Bakr said, \"O Allah Apostle! You have come with the intention of visiting this House (i.e. Ka`ba) and you do not want to kill or fight anybody. So proceed to it, and whoever should stop us from it, we will fight him.\" On that the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Proceed on, in the Name of Allah","grades":[],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":0}}]}
