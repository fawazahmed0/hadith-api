We are the owners of milch livestock (i.e. bedouins) and not farmers (i.e. countrymen).\" They found the climate of Medina unsuitable for them. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered that they should be provided with some milch camels and a shepherd and ordered them to go out of Medina and to drink the camels' milk and urine (as medicine) So they set out and when they reached Al-Harra, they reverted to Heathenism after embracing Islam, and killed the shepherd of the Prophet and drove away the camels. When this news reached the Prophet, he sent some people in pursuit of them. (So they were caught and brought back to the Prophet (ﷺ) ). The Prophet (ﷺ) gave his orders in their concern. So their eyes were branded with pieces of iron and their hands and legs were cut off and they were left away in Harra till they died in that state of theirs.
