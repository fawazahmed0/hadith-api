'So celebrate the Praises Of your Lord and ask for His forgiveness, Truly, He is the One Who accepts repentance and forgives.\" (110.1-3) Some of them replied, \"We are ordered to praise Allah and repent to Him if we are helped and granted victory.\" Some said, \"We do not know.\" Others kept quiet. `Umar then said to me, \"Do you say similarly?\" I said, \"No.\" `Umar said \"What do you say then?\" I said, \"This Verse indicates the approaching of the death of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) of which Allah informed him.
