So they seemed to have felt angry and sad as they did not get the same as other people had got. The Prophet (ﷺ) then delivered a sermon before them, saying, \"O, the assembly of Ansar! Didn't I find you astray, and then Allah guided you on the Right Path through me? You were divided into groups, and Allah brought you together through me; you were poor and Allah made you rich through me.\" Whatever the Prophet (ﷺ) said , they (i.e. the Ansar) said, \"Allah and his Apostle have more favours to do.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"What stops you from answering the Messenger of Allah?\" But whatever he said to them, they replied, \"Allah and His Apostle have more favours to do.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, \"If you wish you could say: 'You came to us in such-and-such state (at Medina).' Wouldn't you be willing to see the people go away with sheep and camels while you go with the Prophet (ﷺ) to your homes? But for the migration, I would have been one of the Ansar, and if the people took their way through a valley or mountain pass, I would select the valley or mountain pass of the Ansar. The Ansar are Shiar (i.e. those clothes which are in direct contact with the body and worn inside the other garments), and the people are Dithar (i.e. those clothes which are not in direct contact with the body and are worn over other garments). No doubt, you will see other people favoured over you, so you should be patient till you meet me at the Tank (of Kauthar)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":359}}]}
