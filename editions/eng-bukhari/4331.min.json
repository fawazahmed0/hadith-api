The Ansar (then) said, \"May Allah forgive Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)s as he gives to Quraish and leaves us although our swords are still dribbling with the blood of Quraish.\" Allah Apostle was informed of their statement, so he sent for the Ansar and gathered them in a leather tent, and did not call anybody else along with them. When they al I gathered, the Prophet (ﷺ) got up and said, \"What is this talk being informed to me about you?\" The learned men amongst the Ansar said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Our chiefs did not say anything, but some people amongst us who are younger in age said. 'May Allah forgive Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as he gives (of the booty) to Quraish and leaves us though our swords are still dribbling with their blood.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I give to these men who have newly deserted heathenism (and embraced Islam) so as to attract their hearts. Won't you be happy that the people take the wealth while you take the Prophet (ﷺ) with you to your homes? By Allah, what you are taking is better than whatever they are taking.\" They (i.e. the Ansar) said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We are satisfied.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then said to them. \"You will find others favored over you greatly, so be patient till you meet Allah and His Apostle and I will be at the Tank then.\" Anas added: But they did not remain patient","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":360}}]}
