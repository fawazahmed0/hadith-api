I used not to sit firm over horses, so I informed the Prophet (ﷺ) of that, and he stroke my chest with his hand till I saw the marks of his hand over my chest and he said, O Allah! Make him firm and one who guides others and is guided (on the right path).' Since then I have never fallen from a horse. Dhul-l--Khulasa was a house in Yemen belonging to the tribe of Khatham and Bajaila, and in it there were idols which were worshipped, and it was called Al-Ka`ba.\" Jarir went there, burnt it with fire and dismantled it. When Jarir reached Yemen, there was a man who used to foretell and give good omens by casting arrows of divination. Someone said to him. \"The messenger of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is present here and if he should get hold of you, he would chop off your neck.\" One day while he was using them (i.e. arrows of divination), Jarir stopped there and said to him, \"Break them (i.e. the arrows) and testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, or else I will chop off your neck.\" So the man broke those arrows and testified that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah. Then Jarir sent a man called Abu Artata from the tribe of Ahmas to the Prophet to convey the good news (of destroying Dhu-l-Khalasa). So when the messenger reached the Prophet, he said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I did not leave it till it was like a scabby camel.\" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) blessed the horses of Ahmas and their men five times","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":383}}]}
