We were struck with severe hunger and the sea threw out a dead fish the like of which we had never seen, and it was called Al-`Anbar. We ate of it for half a month. Abu Ubaida took (and fixed) one of its bones and a rider passed underneath it (without touching it). (Jabir added:) Abu 'Ubaida said (to us), \"Eat (of that fish).\" When we arrived at Medina, we informed the Prophet (ﷺ) about that, and he said, \"Eat, for it is food Allah has brought out for you, and feed us if you have some of it.\" So some of them gave him (of that fish) and he ate it",
