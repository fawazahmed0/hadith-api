If I drink much of it and stay with the people for a long time, I get afraid that they may discover it (for I will appear as if I were drunk). Ibn `Abbas said, \"A delegation of `Abdul Qais came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he said, \"Welcome, O people! Neither will you have disgrace nor will you regret.\" They said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! There are the Mudar pagans between you and us, so we cannot come to you except in the sacred Months. So please teach us some orders on acting upon which we will enter Paradise. Besides, we will preach that to our people who are behind us.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I order you to do four things and forbid you from four things (I order you): To believe in Allah...Do you know what is to believe in Allah? That is to testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah: (I order you also to offer prayers perfectly to pay Zakat; and to fast the month of Ramadan and to give the Khumus (i.e. one-fifth of the booty) (for Allah's Sake).
