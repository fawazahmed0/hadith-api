Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went to him in the company of Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas, and at that time, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had a stick of a date-palm tree in his hand. When he (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ) stopped near Musailima while the latter was amidst his companions, he said to him, \"If you ask me for this piece (of stick), I will not give it to you, and Allah's Order you cannot avoid, (but you will be destroyed), and if you turn your back from this religion, then Allah will destroy you. And I think you are the same person who was shown to me in my dream, and this is Thabit bin Qais who will answer your questions on my behalf.\" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) went away from him. I asked about the statement of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) : \"You seem to be the same person who was shown to me in my dream,\" and Abu Huraira informed me that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"When I was sleeping, I saw (in a dream) two bangles of gold on my hands and that worried me. And then I was inspired Divinely in the dream that I should blow on them, so I blew on them and both the bangles flew away. And I interpreted it that two liars (who would claim to be prophets) would appear after me. One of them has proved to be Al Ansi and the other, Musailima","grades":[],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":0}}]}
