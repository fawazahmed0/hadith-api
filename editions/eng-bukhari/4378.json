			"text": "Narrated Ubaidullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utba:We were informed that Musailima Al-Kadhdhab had arrived in Medina and stayed in the house of the daughter of Al-Harith. The daughter of Al-Harith bin Kuraiz was his wife and she was the mother of `Abdullah bin 'Amir. There came to him Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) accompanied by Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas who was called the orator of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had a stick in his hand then. The Prophet (ﷺ) stopped before Musailima and spoke to him. Musailima said to him, \"If you wish, we would not interfere between you and the rule, on condition that the rule will be ours after you... The Prophet said, \"If you asked me for this stick, I would not give it to you. I think you are the same person who was shown to me in a dream. And this is Thabit bin Al-Qais who will answer you on my behalf.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then went away. I asked Ibn `Abbas about the dream Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had mentioned. Ibn `Abbas said, \"Someone told me that the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"When I was sleeping, I saw in a dream that two gold bangles were put in my hands, and that frightened me and made me dislike them. Then I was allowed to blow on them, and when I blew at them, both of them flew. Then I interpreted them as two liars who would appear.' One of them was Al-`Ansi who was killed by Fairuz in Yemen and the other was Musailima Al-Kadhdbab",
