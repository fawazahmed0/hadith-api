Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to us, \"Whoever has got the Hadi should assume the Ihram for Hajj and `Umra and should not finish his Ihram till he has performed both (`Umra and Hajj).\" I arrived at Mecca along with him (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ) while I was menstruating, so I did not perform the Tawaf around the Ka`ba or between Safa and Marwa. I informed Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about that and he said, \"Undo your braids and comb your hair, and then assume the lhram for Hajj and leave the `Umra.\" I did so, and when we performed and finished the Hajj, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)s sent me to at-Tan`im along with (my brother) `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, to perform the `Umra. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"This `Umra is in lieu of your missed `Umra.\" Those who had assumed the lhram for `Umra, performed the Tawaf around the Ka`ba and between Safa and Marwa, and then finished their Ihram, and on their return from Mina, they performed another Tawaf (around the Ka`ba and between Safa and Marwa), but those who combined their Hajj and `Umra, performed only one Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) (for both)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":418}}]}
