Al-Mughira added. \"The Prophet (ﷺ) washed his face, and when he wanted to wash his forearms, the sleeves of his cloak became tight over them, so he took them out from underneath the cloak and then he washed them (i.e. his forearms) and passed wet hands over his Khuffs (socks made from thick fabric or leather)",
