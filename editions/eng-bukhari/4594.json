			"text": "Narrated Al-Bara:When the Verse:--\"Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home),\" (4.95) was revealed, the Prophet said, \"Call so-and-so.\" That person came to him with an ink-pot and a wooden board or a shoulder scapula bone. The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), \"Write: 'Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and those who strive and fight in the Cause of Allah.\" Ibn Um Maktum who was sitting behind the Prophet (ﷺ) then said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I am a blind man.\" So there was revealed in the place of that Verse, the Verse:--\"Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home) except those who are disabled (by injury, or are blind or lame etc.) and those who strive and fight in the Cause of Allah.\" (4.95)",
