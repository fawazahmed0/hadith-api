An arrow used to be shot which would hit one of them (the Muslims in the company of the pagans) and kill him, or he would be struck and killed (with a sword).\" Then Allah revealed:-- \"Verily! as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (by staying among the disbelievers)\" (4.97) Abu AlAswad also narrated it",
