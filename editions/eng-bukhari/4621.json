He said, \"If you but knew what I know then you would have laughed little and wept much.\" On hearing that, the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) covered their faces and the sound of their weeping was heard. A man said, \"Who is my father?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"So-and-so.\" So this Verse was revealed: \"Ask not about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble.\" (5.101)",
