You will be gathered before Allah barefooted, naked and not circumcised.\" Then (quoting Qur'an) he said:-- \"As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it. A promise We have undertaken: Truly we shall do it..\" (21.104) The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, \"The first of the human beings to be dressed on the Day of Resurrection, will be Abraham. Lo!

You were the Watcher over them and You are a Witness to all things.' (5.117) Then it will be said, \"These people have continued to be apostates since you left them",
