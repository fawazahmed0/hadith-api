Abu `Aqil came with one half of a Sa` (special measure for food grains) and another person brought more than he did. So the hypocrites said, \"Allah is not in need of the alms of this (i.e. Abu `Aqil); and this other person did not give alms but for showing off.\" Then Allah revealed:-- 'Those who criticize such of the Believers who give charity voluntarily and those who could not find to give in charity except what is available to them.'
