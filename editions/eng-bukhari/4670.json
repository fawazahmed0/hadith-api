			"text": "Narrated Ibn `Abbas:When `Abdullah bin 'Ubai died, his son `Abdullah bin `Abdullah came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and asked him to give him his shirt in order to shroud his father in it. He gave it to him and then `Abdullah asked the Prophet (ﷺ) to offer the funeral prayer for him (his father). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up to offer the funeral prayer for him, but `Umar got up too and got hold of the garment of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) Will you offer the funeral prayer for him though your Lord has forbidden you to offer the prayer for him\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"But Allah has given me the choice by saying: '(Whether you) ask forgiveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness for them; even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times..' (9.80) so I will ask more than seventy times.\" `Umar said, \"But he (`Abdullah bin 'Ubai) is a hypocrite!\" However, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did offer the funeral prayer for him whereupon Allah revealed: 'And never (O Muhammad) pray for anyone of them that dies, nor stand at his grave.'
