Each of them related a part of the narration (wherein) the Prophet (ﷺ) said (to `Aisha). \"If you are innocent, then Allah will declare your innocence: but if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allah's Forgiveness and repent to him.\" `Aisha said, \"By Allah, I find no example for my case except that of Joseph's father (when he said), 'So (for me) patience is most fitting.' \" Then Allah revealed the ten Verses:-- \"Verily those who spread the slander are a gang amongst you..\" (24.11)",
