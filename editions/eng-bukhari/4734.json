He said, \"I will not give you (your due) till you disbelieve in Muhammad.\" Khabbab said, \"By Allah, I shall not disbelieve in Muhammad till Allah makes you die and then resurrects you.\" Al-Asi said, \"So leave me till I die and then be resurrected, for I will be given wealth and children whereupon I will pay you your debt.\" So this Verse was revealed:-- 'Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our Signs and, (yet) says: I shall certainly be given wealth and children.'
