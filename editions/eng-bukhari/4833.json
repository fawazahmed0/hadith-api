He asked again, but he did not reply, and then he asked (for the third time) but he did not reply. On that, `Umar bin Al-Khattab said to himself, \"Thakilat Ummu `Umar (May `Umar's mother lose her son)! I asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) three times but he did not reply.\" `Umar then said, \"I made my camel run faster and went ahead of the people, and I was afraid that some Qur'anic Verses might be revealed about me. But before getting involved in any other matter. I heard somebody calling me. I said to myself, 'I fear that some Qur'anic Verses have been revealed about me,' and so I went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and greeted him. He (Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ) said, 'Tonight a Sura has been revealed to me, and it is dearer to me than that on which the sun rises (i.e. the world)' Then he recited: \"Verily, We have given you a manifest victory.\" (48.1)",
