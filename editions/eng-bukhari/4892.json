Thereupon a lady withdrew her hand (refrained from taking the oath of allegiance), and said, \"But such-and-such lady lamented over one of my relatives, so I must reward (do the same over the dead relatives of) hers.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) did not object to that, so she went (there) and returned to the Prophet (ﷺ) so he accepted her pledge of allegiance",
