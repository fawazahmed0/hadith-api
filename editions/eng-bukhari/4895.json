			"text": "Narrated Ibn `Abbas:I witnessed the `Id-al-Fitr prayer with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) , Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Uthman; and all of them offered it before delivering the sermon... and then delivered the sermon. Once the Prophet (after completing the prayer and the sermon) came down, as if I am now looking at him waving at the men with his hand to sit down, and walked through them till he, along with Bilal, reached (the rows of) the women. Then he recited: 'O Prophet! When believing women come to you to take the oath of allegiance that they will not worship anything other than Allah, will not steal, will not commit illegal sexual intercourse, will not kill their children, and will not utter slander, intentionally forging falsehood (by making illegal children belonging to their husbands)'....(60.12) Having finished, he said, 'Do you agree to that?\" One lady, other than whom none replied the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Yes, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" (The, sub-narrator, Al-Hasan did not know who the lady was.) Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said to them: \"Will you give alms?\" Thereupon Bilal spread out his garment and the women started throwing big rings and small rings into Bilal's garment. (See Hadith No. 95 vol.2)",
