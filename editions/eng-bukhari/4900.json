I heard `Abdullah bin Ubai (bin Abi Salul) saying. \"Don't spend on those who are with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), that they may disperse and go away from him. If we return (to Medina), surely, the more honorable will expel the meaner amongst them.\" I reported that (saying) to my uncle or to `Umar who, in his turn, informed the Prophet (ﷺ) of it.
