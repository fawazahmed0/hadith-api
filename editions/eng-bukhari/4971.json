Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went out, and when he had ascended As-Safa mountain, he shouted, \"O Sabahah!\" The people said, \"Who is that?\" \"Then they gathered around him, whereupon he said, \"Do you see? If I inform you that cavalrymen are proceeding up the side of this mountain, will you believe me?\" They said, \"We have never heard you telling a lie.\" Then he said, \"I am a plain warner to you of a coming severe punishment.\" Abu Lahab said, \"May you perish! You gathered us only for this reason? \" Then Abu Lahab went away. So the \"Surat:--ul--LAHAB\" 'Perish the hands of Abu Lahab!' (111.1) was revealed",
