What is your opinion regarding a man who assumes Ihram and puts on a cloak after perfuming his body with scent?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) waited for a while, and then the Divine Inspiration descended upon him. `Umar pointed out to Ya`la, telling him to come. Ya`la came and pushed his head (underneath the screen which was covering the Prophet (ﷺ) ) and behold! The Prophet's face was red and he kept on breathing heavily for a while and then he was relieved. Thereupon he said, \"Where is the questioner who asked me about `Umra a while ago?\" The man was sought and then was brought before the Prophet (ﷺ) who said (to him), \"As regards the scent which you perfumed your body with, you must wash it off thrice, and as for your cloak, you must take it off; and then perform in your `Umra all those things which you perform in Hajj","grades":[],"reference":{"book":66,"hadith":7}}]}
