That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, \"O my nephew! (This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to marry her with a Mahr less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full Mahr, and they are ordered to marry other women instead of them","grades":[],"reference":{"book":67,"hadith":2}}]}
