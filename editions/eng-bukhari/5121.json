(If you are not in need of her) marry her to me.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"What have you got?\" The man said, \"I have nothing.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), \"Go and search for something) even if it were an iron ring.\" The man went and returned saying, \"No, I have not found anything, not even an iron ring; but this is my (Izar) waist sheet, and half of it is for her.\" He had no Rida' (upper garment). The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"What will she do with your waist sheet? If you wear it, she will have nothing over her; and if she wears it, you will have nothing over you.\" So the man sat down and when he had sat a long time, he got up (to leave). When the Prophet (ﷺ) saw him (leaving), he called him back, or the man was called (for him), and he said to the man, \"How much of the Qur'an do you know (by heart)?\" The man replied I know such Sura and such Sura (by heart),\" naming the Suras The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I have married her to you for what you know of the Qur'an",
