During one of his journeys the lot fell on `Aisha and Hafsa. When night fell the Prophet (ﷺ) would ride beside `Aisha and talk with her. One night Hafsa said to `Aisha, \"Won't you ride my camel tonight and I ride yours, so that you may see (me) and I see (you) (in new situation)?\" `Aisha said, \"Yes, (I agree.)\" So `Aisha rode, and then the Prophet (ﷺ) came towards `Aisha's camel on which Hafsa was riding. He greeted Hafsa and then proceeded (beside her) till they dismounted (on the way). `Aisha missed him, and so, when they dismounted, she put her legs in the Idhkhir and said, \"O Lord (Allah)! Send a scorpion or a snake to bite me for I am not to blame him (the Prophet (ﷺ)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":67,"hadith":144}}]}
