She could not get her satisfaction from him, and after a while he divorced her. Then she came to the Prophet and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! My first husband divorced me and then I married another man who entered upon me to consummate his marriage but he proved to be impotent and did not approach me except once during which he benefited nothing from me. Can I remarry my first husband in this case?\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"It is unlawful to marry your first husband till the other husband consummates his marriage with you",
