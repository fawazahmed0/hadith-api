Once he went to Hafsa, the daughter of `Umar and stayed with her more than usual. I got jealous and asked the reason for that. I was told that a lady of her folk had given her a skin filled with honey as a present, and that she made a syrup from it and gave it to the Prophet (ﷺ) to drink (and that was the reason for the delay). I said, \"By Allah we will play a trick on him (to prevent him from doing so).\" So I said to Sa`da bint Zam`a \"The Prophet (ﷺ) will approach you, and when he comes near you, say: 'Have you taken Maghafir (a bad-smelling gum)?' He will say, 'No.' Then say to him: 'Then what is this bad smell which i smell from you?' He will say to you, 'Hafsa made me drink honey syrup.' Then say: Perhaps the bees of that honey had sucked the juice of the tree of Al-`Urfut.' I shall also say the same. O you, Safiyya, say the same.\" Later Sa`da said, \"By Allah, as soon as he (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) stood at the door, I was about to say to him what you had ordered me to say because I was afraid of you.\" So when the Prophet (ﷺ) came near Sa`da, she said to him, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Have you taken Maghafir?\" He said, \"No.\" She said. \"Then what is this bad smell which I detect on you?\" He said, \"Hafsa made me drink honey syrup.\" She said, \"Perhaps its bees had sucked the juice of Al-`Urfut tree.\" When he came to me, I also said the same, and when he went to Safiyya, she also said the same. And when the Prophet (ﷺ) again went to Hafsa, she said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall I give you more of that drink?\" He said, \"I am not in need of it.\" Sa`da said, \"By Allah, we deprived him (of it).\" I said to her, \"Keep quiet","grades":[],"reference":{"book":68,"hadith":18}}]}
