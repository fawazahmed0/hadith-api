			"text": "Narrated Abu Huraira:A man from Bani Aslam came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) while he was in the mosque and called (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) saying, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have committed illegal sexual intercourse.\" On that the Prophet (ﷺ) turned his face from him to the other side, whereupon the man moved to the side towards which the Prophet (ﷺ) had turned his face, and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have committed illegal sexual intercourse.\" The Prophet turned his face (from him) to the other side whereupon the man moved to the side towards which the Prophet (ﷺ) had turned his face, and repeated his statement. The Prophet (ﷺ) turned his face (from him) to the other side again. The man moved again (and repeated his statement) for the fourth time. So when the man had given witness four times against himself, the Prophet (ﷺ) called him and said, \"Are you insane?\" He replied, \"No.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then said (to his companions), \"Go and stone him to death.\" The man was a married one. Jabir bin `Abdullah Al-Ansari said: I was one of those who stoned him. We stoned him at the Musalla (`Id praying place) in Medina. When the stones hit him with their sharp edges, he fled, but we caught him at Al-Harra and stoned him till he died",
