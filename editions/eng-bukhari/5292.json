He said, \"You should take it, because it is for you, or for your brother, or for the wolf.\" Then he was asked about a lost camel. He got angry and his face became red and he said (to the questioner), \"You have nothing to do with it; it has its feet and its water container with it; it can go on drinking water and eating trees till its owner meets it.\" And then the Prophet (ﷺ) was asked about a Luqata (money found by somebody). He said, \"Remember and recognize its tying material and its container, and make public announcement about it for one year. If somebody comes and identifies it (then give it to him), otherwise add it to your property",
