Her relative brought her to the Prophet (ﷺ) while she was in her last breaths, and she was unable to speak. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked her, \"Who has hit you? So-and so?\", mentioning somebody other than her murderer. She moved her head, indicating denial. The Prophet (ﷺ) mentioned another person other than the murderer, and she again moved her head indicating denial. Then he asked, \"Was it so-and-so?\", mentioning the name of her killer. She nodded, agreeing. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ); ordered that the head of that Jew be crushed between two stones",
