Suppose a man saw another man with his wife, would he kill him whereupon you would kill him; or what should he do? Please, O `Asim, ask about this on my behalf.\" `Asim asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), disliked that question and considered it disgraceful. What `Asim heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was hard on him. When `Asim returned to his family, 'Uwaimir came to him and said, \"O `Asim! What did Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). say to you?\" `Asim said to 'Uwaimir, \"You never bring me any good. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) disliked the problem which I asked him about.\" 'Uwaimir said, \"By Allah, I will not give up this matter until I ask the Prophet (ﷺ) about it.\" So 'Uwaimir proceeded till he came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in the midst of people, and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! If a man sees another man with his wife, would he kill him, whereupon you would kill him, or what should he do?\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Allah has revealed some decree as regards you and your wives case. Go and bring her.\" So they carried out the process of Lian while I was present among the people with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). When they had finished their Lian, 'Uwaimir said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! If I should now keep her with me as a wife, then I have told a lie.\" So he divorced her thrice before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered him. (Ibn Shihab said: So divorce was the tradition for all those who were involved in a case of Lian)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":68,"hadith":57}}]}
