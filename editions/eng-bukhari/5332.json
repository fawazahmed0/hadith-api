Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered him to take her back till she became clean, and when she got another period while she was with him, she should wait till she became clean again and only then, if he wanted to divorce her, he could do so before having sexual relations with her. And that is the period Allah has fixed for divorcing women.

Ibn `Umar further said, 'Would that you (people) only give one or two divorces, because the Prophet (ﷺ) has ordered me so",
