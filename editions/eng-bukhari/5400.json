But it was said to him, \"It is a mastigure.\" So he withdrew his hand. Khalid asked, \"Is it unlawful to eat?\" the Prophet said, \"No, but it is not found in the land of my people and that is why I do not like eating it.\" So Khalid started eating (it) while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was looking at him. An-Nadr said: 'Al-Khazira' (is prepared) from bran while 'Al-Harira' is prepared from milk",
