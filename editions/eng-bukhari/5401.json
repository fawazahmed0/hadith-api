I have lost my eyesight and I lead my people in the prayer (as an Imam). When it rains, the valley which is between me and my people, flows with water, and then I cannot go to their mosque to lead them in the prayer. O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I wish that you could come and pray in my house so that I may take it as a praying place. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Allah willing, I will do that.\" The next morning, soon after the sun had risen, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came with Abu Bakr. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked for the permission to enter and I admitted him. The Prophet (ﷺ) had not sat till he had entered the house and said to me, \"Where do you like me to pray in your house?\" I pointed at a place in my house whereupon he stood and said, \"Allahu Akbar.\" We lined behind him and he prayed two rak`at and finished it with Taslim. We then requested him to stay for a special meal of Khazira which we had prepared. A large number of men from the adjoining area gathered in the house. One of them said, \"Where is Malik bin Ad-Dukhshun?\" Another man said, \"He is a hypocrite and does not love Allah and His Apostle.\" The Prophet said, \"Do not say so. Do you not think that he has said: \"None has the right to be worshipped but Allah,\" seeking Allah's pleasure? The man said, \"Allah and His Apostle know better, but we have always seen him mixing with hypocrites and giving them advice.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Allah has forbidden the (Hell) Fire for those who testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, seeking Allah's pleasure",
