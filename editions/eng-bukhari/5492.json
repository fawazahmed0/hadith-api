			"text": "Narrated Abu Qatada:I was with the Prophet (on a journey) between Mecca and Medina, and all of them, (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions) were in the state of Ihram, while I was not in that state. I was riding my horse and I used to be fond of ascending mountains. So while I was doing so I noticed that the people were looking at something. I went to see what it was, and behold it was an onager. I asked my companions, \"What is that?\" They said, \"We do not know.\" I said, \"It is an onager.' They said, \"It is what you have seen.\" I had left my whip, so I said to them, \"Hand to me my whip.\" They said, \"We will not help you in that (in hunting the onager).\" I got down, took my whip and chased the animal (on my horse) and did not stop till I killed it. I went to them and said, \"Come on, carry it!\" But they said, \"We will not even touch it.\" At last I alone carried it and brought it to them. Some of them ate of it and some refused to eat of it. I said (to them), \"I will ask the Prophet (ﷺ) about it (on your behalf).\" When I met the Prophet, I told him the whole story. He said to me, \"Has anything of it been left with you?\" I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Eat, for it is a meal Allah has offered to you",
