Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stretched his hand out (to eat of it) but some woman said, \"Inform Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) of what he is about to eat.\" So they said, \"It is mastigure, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" He withdrew his hand, whereupon I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Is it unlawful?\" He said, \"No, but this is not found in the land of my people, so I dislike it.\" So I pulled the mastigure towards me and ate it while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was looking at me",
