There is a man who sends a Hadi to Ka`ba and stays in his city and requests that his Hadi camel be garlanded while he remains in a state of Ihram from that day till the people finish their Ihram (after completing all the ceremonies of Hajj)\" (What do you say about it?) Masruq added, I heard the clapping of her hands behind the curtain. She said, \"I used to twist the garlands for the Hadi of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he used to send his Hadi to Ka`ba but he never used to regard as unlawful what was lawful for men to do with their wives till the people returned (from the Hajj)",
