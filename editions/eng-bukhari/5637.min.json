The Prophet (ﷺ) came out and went to her and entered upon her. Behold, it was a lady sitting with a drooping head. When the Prophet (ﷺ) spoke to her, she said, \"I seek refuge with Allah from you.\" He said, \"I grant you refuge from me.\" They said to her, \"Do you know who this is?\" She said, \"No.\" They said, \"This is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who has come to command your hand in marriage.\" She said, \"I am very unlucky to lose this chance.\" Then the Prophet and his companions went towards the shed of Bani Sa`ida and sat there. Then he said, \"Give us water, O Sahl!\" So I took out this drinking bowl and gave them water in it. The sub-narrator added: Sahl took out for us that very drinking bowl and we all drank from it. Later on `Umar bin `Abdul `Aziz requested Sahl to give it to him as a present, and he gave it to him as a present","grades":[],"reference":{"book":74,"hadith":63}}]}
