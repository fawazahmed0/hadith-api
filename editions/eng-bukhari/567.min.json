The Prophet (ﷺ) was in Medina at that time. One of us used to go to the Prophet (ﷺ) by turns every night at the time of the `Isha prayer. Once I along with my companions went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he was busy in some of his affairs, so the `Isha' prayer was delayed to the middle of the night He then came out and led the people (in prayer). After finishing from the prayer, he addressed the people present there saying, \"Be patient! Don't go away. Have the glad tiding. It is from the blessing of Allah upon you that none amongst mankind has prayed at this time save you.\" Or said, \"None except you has prayed at this time.\" Abu Musa added, 'So we returned happily after what we heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":9,"hadith":44}}]}
