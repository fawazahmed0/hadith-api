			"text": "Narrated `Aisha:When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) emigrated to Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal had a fever. I entered upon them and said, \"O my father! How are you? O Bilal! How are you?\" Whenever Abu Bakr got the fever he used to say, \"Everybody is staying alive with his people, yet death is nearer to him than his shoe laces.\" And when fever deserted Bilal, he would recite (two poetic verses): \"Would that I could stay overnight in a valley wherein I would be surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (two kinds of good smelling grass). Would that one day I could drink of the water of Majinna, and would that Shama and Tafil (two mountains at Mecca) would appear to me!\" I went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and informed him about that. He said, \"O Allah! Make us love Medina as much or more than we love Mecca, and make it healthy, and bless its Sa and its Mudd, and take away its fever and put it in Al-Juhfa.\" (See Hadith No 558)",
