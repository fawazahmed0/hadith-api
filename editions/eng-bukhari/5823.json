			"text": "Narrated Um Khalid bint Khalid:The Prophet (ﷺ) was given some clothes including a black Khamisa. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"To whom shall we give this to wear?\" The people kept silent whereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Fetch Um Khalid for me.\" I (Um Khalid) was brought carried (as I was small girl at that time). The Prophet (ﷺ) took the Khamisa in his hands and made me wear it and said, \"May you live so long that your dress will wear out and you will mend it many times.\" On the Khamisa there were some green or pale designs (The Prophet (ﷺ) saw these designs) and said, \"O Um Khalid! This is Sanah.\" (Sanah in a Ethiopian word meaning beautiful)",
