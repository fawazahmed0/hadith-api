Therefore, I like to wear such shoes. As regards dyeing with Sufra, I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) dyeing his hair with it, so I like to dye (my hair) with it. As regards the crescent (of Dhul-Hijja), I have not seen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) assuming the state of Ihram till his she-camel set out (on the 8th of Dhul-Hijja)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":77,"hadith":68}}]}
