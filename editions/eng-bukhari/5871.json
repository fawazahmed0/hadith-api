When she stayed for a Long period, a man said to the Prophet (ﷺ) \"If you are not in need of her, then marry her to me.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Have you got anything to give her (as Mahr)?\" The man said, \"No.\" The Prophet said, \"Go (to your house) and search for something.\" The man went and came back to say, \"By Allah, I could not find anything.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Go again and search for something, even if it be an iron ring.\" He went again and came back saying, \"No, by Allah, I could not get even an iron ring.\" The man had only an Izar and had no Rida' (upper garment). He said, \"I will give her my Izar as Mahr.\" On that the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Your Izar? If she wears it, nothing of it will remain on you, and if you wear it nothing of it will be on her\" The man went aside and sat down When the Prophet (ﷺ) saw him leaving (after a while), he called back and asked. \"How much Qur'an do you know (by heart)? He said, 'I know such and such Suras,\" naming some Suras. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I marry her to you for the amount of Qur'an you know (by heart)",
