'Ubaidullah was asked, \"Does this apply to both girls and boys?\" He said, \"I don't know, but Nafi` said, 'The boy.'\" 'Ubaidullah added, \"I asked Nafi` again, and he said, 'As for leaving hair on the temples and the back part of the boy's head, there is no harm, but Al-Qaza' is to leave a tuft of hair on his forehead unshaved while there is no hair on the rest of his head, and also to leave hair on either side of his head",
