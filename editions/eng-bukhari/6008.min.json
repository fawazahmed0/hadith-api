He was kindhearted and merciful, so he said, \"Return to your families and teach them (religious knowledge) and order them (to do good deeds) and offer your prayers in the way you saw me offering my prayers, and when the stated time for the prayer becomes due, then one of you should pronounce its call (i.e. the Adhan), and the eldest of you should lead you in prayer","grades":[],"reference":{"book":78,"hadith":39}}]}
