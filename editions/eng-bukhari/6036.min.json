Sahl asked the people, \"Do you know what is a Burda?\" The people replied, \"It is a 'Shamla', a sheet with a fringe.\" That woman said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have brought it so that you may wear it.\" So the Prophet (ﷺ) took it because he was in need of it and wore it. A man among his companions, seeing him wearing it, said, \"O Allah's Apostle! Please give it to me to wear.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Yes.\" (and gave him that sheet). When the Prophet left, the man was blamed by his companions who said, \"It was not nice on your part to ask the Prophet for it while you know that he took it because he was in need of it, and you also know that he (the Prophet) never turns down anybody's request that he might be asked for.\" That man said, \"I just wanted to have its blessings as the Prophet (ﷺ) had put it on, so l hoped that I might be shrouded in it","grades":[],"reference":{"book":78,"hadith":66}}]}
