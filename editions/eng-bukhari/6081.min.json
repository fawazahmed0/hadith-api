Some time passed after this event, and then the Prophet (ﷺ) sent a (similar) cloak to him. `Umar brought that cloak back to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, 'You have sent this to me, and you said about a similar one what you said?' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'I have sent it to you so that you may get money by selling it.' Because of this, Ibn `Umar used to hate the silken markings on the garments","grades":[],"reference":{"book":78,"hadith":109}}]}
