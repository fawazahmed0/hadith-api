I was Rifa`a's wife and he divorced me thrice, and then I was married to `Abdur-Rahman bin AzZubair, who, by Allah has nothing with him except something like this fringe, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ),\" showing a fringe she had taken from her covering sheet. Abu Bakr was sitting with the Prophet (ﷺ) while Khalid Ibn Sa`id bin Al-As was sitting at the gate of the room waiting for admission. Khalid started calling Abu Bakr, \"O Abu Bakr! Why don't you reprove this lady from what she is openly saying before Allah's Apostle?\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did nothing except smiling, and then said (to the lady), \"Perhaps you want to go back to Rifa`a? No, (it is not possible), unless and until you enjoy the sexual relation with him (`Abdur Rahman), and he enjoys the sexual relation with you","grades":[],"reference":{"book":78,"hadith":112}}]}
