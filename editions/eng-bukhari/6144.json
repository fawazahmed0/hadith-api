			"text": "Narrated Ibn `Umar:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Inform me of a tree which resembles a Muslim, giving its fruits at every season by the permission of its Lord, and the leaves of which do not fall.\" I thought of the date-palm tree, but I disliked to speak because Abu Bakr and `Umar were present there. When nobody spoke, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"It is the date-palm tree\" When I came out with my father, I said, \"O father! It came to my mind that it was the date-palm tree.\" He said, \"What prevented you from saying it?\" Had you said it, it would have been more dearer to me than such-and-such a thing (fortune).\" I said, \"Nothing prevented me but the fact that neither you nor Abu Bakr spoke, so I disliked to speak (in your presence)",
