			"text": "Narrated Abu Hazim:Sahl said, \"We used to feel happy on Fridays.\" I asked Sahl, \"Why?\" He said, \"There was an old woman of our acquaintance who used to send somebody to Buda'a (Ibn Maslama said, \"Buda'a was a garden of date-palms at Medina). She used to pull out the silq (a kind of vegetable) from its roots and put it in a cooking pot, adding some powdered barley over it (and cook it). After finishing the Jumua (Friday) prayer we used to (pass by her and) greet her, whereupon she would present us with that meal, so we used to feel happy because of that. We used to have neither a midday nap, nor meals, except after the Friday prayer.\" (See Hadith No. 60, Vol.2)",
