And isn't there among you the person whom Allah gave refuge from Satan through the request (tongue) of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? (i.e., `Ammar). Isn't there among you the one who used to carry the Siwak and the cushion (or pillows (of the Prophets)? (i.e., Ibn Mas`ud). How did Ibn Mas`ud use to recite 'By the night as it conceals (the light)?\" (Sura 92). 'Alqama said, \"Wadhdhakari Wal Untha' (And by male and female.\") Abu Ad-Darda added.
