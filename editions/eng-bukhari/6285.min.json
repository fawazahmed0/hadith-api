When he saw her, he welcomed her, saying, \"Welcome, O my daughter!\" Then he made her sit on his right or his left, confided something to her, whereupon she wept bitterly. When he noticed her sorrow, he confided something else to her for the second time, and she started laughing. Only I from among the Prophet's wives said to her, \"(O Fatima), Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) selected you from among us for the secret talk and still you weep?\" When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up (and went away), I asked her, \"What did he confide to you?\" She said, \"I wouldn't disclose the secrets of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)\" But when he died I asked her, \"I beseech you earnestly by what right I have on you, to tell me (that secret talk which the Prophet had with you)\" She said, \"As you ask me now, yes, (I will tell you).\" She informed me, saying, \"When he talked to me secretly the first time, he said that Gabriel used to review the Qur'an with him once every year. He added, 'But this year he reviewed it with me twice, and therefore I think that my time of death has approached. So, be afraid of Allah, and be patient, for I am the best predecessor for you (in the Hereafter).' \" Fatima added, \"So I wept as you (`Aisha) witnessed. And when the Prophet (ﷺ) saw me in this sorrowful state, he confided the second secret to me saying, 'O Fatima! Will you not be pleased that you will be chief of all the believing women (or chief of the women of this nation i.e. my followers?)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":0}}]}
