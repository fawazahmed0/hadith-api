When they went away and the Prophet (ﷺ) entered upon me, I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Two old ladies..\" and told him the whole story. He said, \"They told the truth; the dead are really punished, to the extent that all the animals hear (the sound resulting from) their punishment.\" Since then I always saw him seeking refuge with Allah from the punishment of the grave in his prayers",
