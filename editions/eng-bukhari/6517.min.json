The Muslim said, \"By Him Who gave superiority to Muhammad over all the people.\" On that, the Jew said, \"By Him Who gave superiority to Moses over all the people.\" The Muslim became furious at that and slapped the Jew in the face. The Jew went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and informed him of what had happened between him and the Muslim. Allah's Apostle said, \"Don't give me superiority over Moses, for the people will fall unconscious on the Day of Resurrection and I will be the first to gain consciousness, and behold ! Moses will be there holding the side of Allah's Throne. I will not know whether Moses has been among those people who have become unconscious and then has regained consciousness before me, or has been among those exempted by Allah from falling unconscious","grades":[],"reference":{"book":81,"hadith":106}}]}
