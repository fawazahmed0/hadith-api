			"text": "Narrated Anas:Um (the mother of) Haritha came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) after Haritha had been martyred on the Day (of the battle) of Badr by an arrow thrown by an unknown person. She said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! You know the position of Haritha in my heart (i.e. how dear to me he was), so if he is in Paradise, I will not weep for him, or otherwise, you will see what I will do.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Are you mad? Is there only one Paradise? There are many Paradises, and he is in the highest Paradise of Firdaus.\" The Prophet added, \"A forenoon journey or an after noon journey in Allah's Cause is better than the whole world and whatever is in it; and a place equal to an arrow bow of anyone of you, or a place equal to a foot in Paradise is better than the whole world and whatever is in it; and if one of the women of Paradise looked at the earth, she would fill the whole space between them (the earth and the heaven) with light, and would fill whatever is in between them, with perfume, and the veil of her face is better than the whole world and whatever is in it",
