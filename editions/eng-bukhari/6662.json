Each one of the above four narrators narrated to me a portion of her narration. (It was said in it), \"The Prophet (ﷺ) stood up, saying, 'Is there anyone who can relieve me from `Abdullah bin Ubai?' On that, Usaid bin Hudair got up and said to Sa`d bin 'Ubada, La`Amrullahi (By the Eternity of Allah), we will kill him",
