Has the prayer been reduced, or have you forgotten?\" He asked, \"What is that?\" They said, \"You have prayed so many rak`at.\" So he performed with them two more prostrations and said, \"These two prostrations are to be performed by the person who does not know whether he has prayed more or less (rak`at) in which case he should seek to follow what is right. And then complete the rest (of the prayer) and perform two extra prostrations","grades":[],"reference":{"book":83,"hadith":49}}]}
