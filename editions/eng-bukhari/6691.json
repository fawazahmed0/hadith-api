			"text": "Narrated `Aisha:The Prophet (ﷺ) used to stay (for a period) in the house of Zainab bint Jahsh (one of the wives of the Prophet ) and he used to drink honey in her house. Hafsa and I decided that when the Prophet (ﷺ) entered upon either of us, she would say, \"I smell in you the bad smell of Maghafir (a bad smelling raisin). Have you eaten Maghafir?\" When he entered upon one of us, she said that to him. He replied (to her), \"No, but I have drunk honey in the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, and I will never drink it again.\" Then the following verse was revealed: 'O Prophet ! Why do you ban (for you) that which Allah has made lawful for you?. ..(up to) If you two (wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) turn in repentance to Allah.' (66.1-4) The two were `Aisha and Hafsa And also the Statement of Allah: 'And (Remember) when the Prophet (ﷺ) disclosed a matter in confidence to one of his wives!' (66.3) i.e., his saying, \"But I have drunk honey.\" Hisham said: It also meant his saying, \"I will not drink anymore, and I have taken an oath, so do not inform anybody of that",
