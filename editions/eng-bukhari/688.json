On completion of the prayer, he said, 'The Imam is to be followed: bow when he bows, raise up your heads (stand erect) when he raises his head and when he says, 'Sami`a l-lahu liman hamidah' (Allah heard those who sent praises to Him) say then 'Rabbana wa laka l-hamd' (O our Lord! All the praises are for You), and if he prays sitting then pray sitting",
