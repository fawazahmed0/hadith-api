Beware of what is behind you!\" So the front file of the army attacked the back files (mistaking them for the enemy) till they killed Al-Yaman. Hudhaifa (bin Al- Yaman) shouted, \"My father!\" My father! But they killed him. Hudhaifa said, \"May Allah forgive you.\" (The narrator added: Some of the defeated pagans fled till they reached Taif)",
