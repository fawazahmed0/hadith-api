When he improved and felt a bit better he said (to us.) \"Didn't I forbid you to pour medicine into my mouth?\" We said, \"We thought (you did so) because of the aversion, one usually have for medicine.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"There is none of you but will be forced to drink medicine, and I will watch you, except Al-`Abbas, for he did not witness this act of yours",
