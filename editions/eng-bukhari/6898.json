			"text": "Narrated Sahl bin Abi Hathma:(a man from the Ansar) that a number of people from his tribe went to Khaibar and dispersed, and then they found one of them murdered. They said to the people with whom the corpse had been found, \"You have killed our companion!\" Those people said, \"Neither have we killed him, nor do we know his killer.\" The bereaved group went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We went to Khaibar and found one of us murdered.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Let the older among you come forward and speak.\" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, to them, \"Bring your proof against the killer.\" They said \"We have no proof.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Then they (the defendants) will take an oath.\" They said, \"We do not accept the oaths of the Jews.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not like that the Blood-money of the killed one be lost without compensation, so he paid one-hundred camels out of the camels of Zakat (to the relatives of the deceased) as Diya (Blood-money)",
