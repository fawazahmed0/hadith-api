Once he visited Hafsa and remained with her longer than the period he used to stay, so I enquired about it. It was said to me, \"A woman from her tribe gave her a leather skin containing honey as a present, and she gave some of it to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to drink.\" I said, \"By Allah, we will play a trick on him.\" So I mentioned the story to Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) and said to her, \"When he enters upon you, he will come near to you whereupon you should say to him, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!

I said, 'Its bees must have sucked Al-`Urfut.' \" When he entered upon me, I told him the same as that, and when he entered upon Safiya, she too told him the same. So when he visited Hafsa again, she said to him, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall I give you a drink of it (honey)?\" He said, \"I have no desire for it.\" Sauda said, Subhan Allah!
