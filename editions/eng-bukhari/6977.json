			"text": "Narrated 'Amr bin Ash-Sharid: Al-Miswar bin Makhrama came and put his hand on my shoulder and I accompanied him to Sa'd. Abu Rafi' said to Al-Miswar, \"Won't you order this (i.e. Sa'd) to buy my house which is in my yard?\" Sa'd said, \"I will not offer more than four hundred in installments over a fixed period.\" Abu Rafi said, \"I was offered five hundred cash but I refused. Had I not heard the Prophet (ﷺ) saying, 'A neighbor is more entitled to receive the care of his neighbor,' I would not have sold it to you.\" The narrator said, to Sufyan: Ma'mar did not say so. Sufyan said, \"But he did say so to me.\" Some people said, \"If someone wants to sell a house and deprived somebody of the right of preemption, he has the right to play a trick to render the preemption invalid. And that is by giving the house to the buyer as a present and marking its boundaries and giving it to him. The buyer then gives the seller one-thousand Dirham as compensation in which case the preemptor loses his right of preemption",
