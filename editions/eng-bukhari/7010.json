			"text": "Narrated Qais bin 'Ubada:I was sitting in a gathering in which there was Sa`d bin Malik and Ibn `Umar. `Abdullah bin Salam passed in front of them and they said, \"This man is from the people of Paradise.\" I said to `Abdullah bin Salam, \"They said so-and-so.\" He replied, \"Subhan Allah! They ought not to have said things of which they have no knowledge, but I saw (in a dream) that a post was fixed in a green garden. At the top of the post there was a handhold and below it there was a servant. I was asked to climb (the post). So I climbed it till I got hold of the handhold.\" Then I narrated this dream to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Allah's Apostle said, \"`Abdullah will die while still holding the firm reliable handhold (i.e., Islam)",
