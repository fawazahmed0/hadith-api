Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) would interpret them as Allah wished. I was a young man and used to stay in the mosque before my wedlock. I said to myself, \"If there were any good in myself, I too would see what these people see.\" So when I went to bed one night, I said, \"O Allah! If you see any good in me, show me a good dream.\" So while I was in that state, there came to me (in a dream) two angels. In the hand of each of them, there was a mace of iron, and both of them were taking me to Hell, and I was between them, invoking Allah, \"O Allah! I seek refuge with You from Hell.\" Then I saw myself being confronted by another angel holding a mace of iron in his hand. He said to me, \"Do not be afraid, you will be an excellent man if you only pray more often.\" So they took me till they stopped me at the edge of Hell, and behold, it was built inside like a well and it had side posts like those of a well, and beside each post there was an angel carrying an iron mace. I saw therein many people hanging upside down with iron chains, and I recognized therein some men from the Quraish. Then (the angels) took me to the right side. I narrated this dream to (my sister) Hafsa and she told it to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"No doubt, `Abdullah is a good man.\" (Nafi` said, \"Since then `Abdullah bin `Umar used to pray much)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":0}}]}
