He found Mu`adh praying so he made his camel kneel and joined Mu`adh in the prayer. The latter recited Surat 'Al-Baqara\" or Surat \"An-Nisa\", (so) the man left the prayer and went away. When he came to know that Mu`adh had criticized him, he went to the Prophet, and complained against Mu`adh. The Prophet said thrice, \"O Mu`adh ! Are you putting the people to trial?\" It would have been better if you had recited \"Sabbih Isma Rabbika-l-A`la (87)\", Wash-shamsi wa duhaha (91)\", or \"Wal-laili idha yaghsha (92)\", for the old, the weak and the needy pray behind you.\" Jabir said that Mu`adh recited Sura Al-Baqara in the `Isha' prayer","grades":[],"reference":{"book":10,"hadith":100}}]}
