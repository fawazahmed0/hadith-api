			"text": "Narrated Anas:The people started asking the Prophet (ﷺ) too many questions importunately. So one day he ascended the pulpit and said, \"You will not ask me any question but I will explain it to you.\" I looked right and left, and behold, every man was covering his head with his garment and weeping. Then got up a man who, whenever quarreling with somebody, used to be accused of not being the son of his father. He said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Who is my father?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, \"Your father is Hudhaifa.\" Then `Umar got up and said, \"We accept Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion and Muhammad as our Apostle and we seek refuge with Allah from the evil of afflictions.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \" I have never seen the good and bad like on this day. No doubt, Paradise and Hell was displayed in front of me till I saw them in front of that wall,\" Qatada said: This Hadith used to be mentioned as an explanation of this Verse:-- 'O you who believe! Ask not questions about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble.' (5.101)",
