Al-Ashath said, \"This verse was revealed regarding me and another man with whom I had a quarrel about a well. The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to me), \"Do you have any evidence?' I replied, 'No.' He said, 'Let your opponent take an oath.' I said: I am sure he would take a (false) oath.\" Thereupon it was revealed: 'Verily! those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah's Covenant....' (3.77) (See Hadith No. 72, Vol 6)",
