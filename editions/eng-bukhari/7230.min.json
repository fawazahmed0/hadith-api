The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered us to perform the Tawaf around the Ka`ba and (Sa`i) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and use our lhram just for `Umra, and finish the state of Ihram unless we had our Hadi with us. None of us had the Hadi with him except the Prophet (ﷺ) and Talha. `Ali came from Yemen and brought the Hadi with him. `Ali said, 'I had assumed the state of Ihram with the same intention as that with which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had assumed it. The people said, \"How can we proceed to Mina and our male organs are dribbling?\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"If I had formerly known what I came to know latterly, I would not have brought the Hadi, and had there been no Hadi with me, I would have finished my Ihram.\" Suraqa (bin Malik) met the Prophet (ﷺ) while he was throwing pebbles at the Jamrat-Al-`Aqaba, and asked, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Is this (permitted) for us only?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied. \"No, it is forever\" `Aisha had arrived at Mecca while she was menstruating, therefore the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered her to perform all the ceremonies of Hajj except the Tawaf around the Ka`ba, and not to perform her prayers unless and until she became clean . When they encamped at Al-Batha, `Aisha said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! You are proceeding after performing both Hajj and `Umra while I am proceeding with Hajj only?\" So the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to go with her to at-Tan`im, and so she performed the `Umra in Dhul-Hijja after the days of the Hajj","grades":[],"reference":{"book":94,"hadith":5}}]}
