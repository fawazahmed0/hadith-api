He ordered them to believe in Allah, and asked them, \"Do you know what is meant by belief in Allah?\" They said, \"Allah and His Apostle know best.\" He said, ''To testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, the One, Who has no partners with Him, and that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ); and to offer prayers perfectly and to pay Zakat.\" (the narrator thinks that fasting in Ramadan is included), \"and to give one-fifth of the war booty (to the state).\" Then he forbade four (drinking utensils): Ad-Duba', Al56 Hantam, Al-Mazaffat and An-Naqir, or probably, Al-Muqaiyar. And then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Remember all these things by heart and preach it to those whom you have left behind",
