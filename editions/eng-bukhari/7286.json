			"text": "Narrated `Abdullah bin `Abbas:Uyaina bin Hisn bin Hudhaifa bin Badr came and stayed (at Medina) with his nephew Al-Hurr bin Qais bin Hisn who was one of those whom `Umar used to keep near him, as the Qurra' (learned men knowing Qur'an by heart) were the people of `Umar's meetings and his advisors whether they were old or young. 'Uyaina said to his nephew, \"O my nephew! Have you an approach to this chief so as to get for me the permission to see him?\" His nephew said, \"I will get the permission for you to see him.\" (Ibn `Abbas added: ) So he took the permission for 'Uyaina, and when the latter entered, he said, \"O the son of Al-Khattab! By Allah, you neither give us sufficient provision nor judge among us with justice.\" On that `Umar became so furious that he intended to harm him. Al-Hurr, said, \"O Chief of the Believers!\" Allah said to His Apostle 'Hold to forgiveness, command what is good (right), and leave the foolish (i.e. do not punish them).' (7.199) and this person is among the foolish.\" By Allah, `Umar did not overlook that Verse when Al-Hurr recited it before him, and `Umar said to observe (the orders of) Allah's Book strictly.\" (See Hadith No. 166, Vol. 6)",
