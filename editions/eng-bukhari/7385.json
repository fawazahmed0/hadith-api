O Allah! Forgive me my sins that I did in the past or will do in the future, and also the sins I did in secret or in public. You are my only God (Whom I worship) and there is no other God for me (i.e. I worship none but You).\" Narrated Sufyan: (regarding the above narration) that the Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"You are the Truth, and Your Word is the Truth",
