When it was the last third of the night (or part of it), the Prophet (ﷺ) got up and looked towards the sky and recited the Verse:-- 'Verily! In the creation of the Heavens and the Earth....there are indeed signs for the men of understanding.' (3.190) Then He got up and performed the ablution, brushed his teeth and offered eleven rak`at. Then Bilal pronounced the Adhan whereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) offered a two-rak`at (Sunna) prayer and went out to lead the people in Fajr (morning compulsory congregational prayer)",
