			"text": "Narrated Abu Huraira:\"A man from the Muslims and a man from the Jews quarrelled, and the Muslim said, \"By Him Who gave superiority to Muhammad over all the people!\" The Jew said, \"By Him Who gave superiority to Moses over all the people!' On that the Muslim lifted his hand and slapped the Jew. The Jew went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and informed him of all that had happened between him and the Muslim. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Do not give me superiority over Moses, for the people will fall unconscious on the Day of Resurrection, I will be the first to regain consciousness and behold, Moses will be standing there, holding the side of the Throne. I will not know whether he has been one of those who have fallen unconscious and then regained consciousness before me, or if he has been one of those exempted by Allah (from falling unconscious).\" (See Hadith No. 524, Vol. 8)",
