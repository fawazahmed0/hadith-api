The Prophet (ﷺ) returned the greeting and said to him, \"Go back and pray, for you have not prayed.\" The man went back prayed in the same way as before, returned and greeted the Prophet who said, \"Go back and pray, for you have not prayed.\" This happened thrice. The man said, \"By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I cannot offer the prayer in a better way than this. Please, teach me how to pray.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"When you stand for Prayer say Takbir and then recite from the Holy Qur'an (of what you know by heart) and then bow till you feel at ease. Then raise your head and stand up straight, then prostrate till you feel at ease during your prostration, then sit with calmness till you feel at ease (do not hurry) and do the same in all your prayers",
