When he finished that Surah, he would recite another one with it. He followed the same procedure in each Rak'a. His companions discussed this with him and said, \"You recite this Surah and do not consider it sufficient and then you recite another.

Why do you read this Surah particularly in every Rak'a ?\" He repiled, \"I love this Surah.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Your love for this Surah will make you enter Paradise",
