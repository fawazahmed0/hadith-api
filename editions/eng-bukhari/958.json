Ata told me that Ibn `Abbas and Jabir bin `Abdullah, had said, \"There was no Adhan for the prayer of `Id-ul-Fitr and `Id-ul-Aqha.\" `Ata' said, \"I heard Jabir bin `Abdullah saying, 'The Prophet (ﷺ) stood up and started with the prayer, and after it he delivered the Khutba. When the Prophet (ﷺ) of Allah (p.b.u.h) finished (the Khutba), he went to the women and preached to them, while he was leaning on Bilal's hand. Bilal was spreading his garment and the ladies were putting alms in it.' \" I said to Ata, \"Do you think it incumbent upon an Imam to go to the women and preach to them after finishing the prayer and Khutba?\" `Ata' said, \"No doubt it is incumbent on Imams to do so, and why should they not do so?",
