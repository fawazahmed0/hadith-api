So anyone who does so he acted according to our Sunna; and whoever slaughtered before the prayer then it was just meat that he offered to his family and would not be considered as a sacrifice in any way. My uncle Abu Burda bin Niyyar got up and said, \"O, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer but I have a young she-goat which is better than an older sheep.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Slaughter it in lieu of the first and such a goat will not be considered as a sacrifice for anybody else after you",
