Then a person from the Ansar stood up and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! because of my neighbors (he described them as being very needy or poor) I slaughtered before the prayer. I have a young she-goat which, in my opinion, is better than two sheep.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) gave him the permission for slaughtering it as a sacrifice",
