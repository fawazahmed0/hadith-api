			"text": "Narrated Ibn `Abbas:Once I passed the night in the house of Maimuna (his aunt). I slept across the bed while Allah's Apostle and his wife slept length-wise. The Prophet (ﷺ) slept till midnight or nearly so and woke up rubbing his face and recited ten verses from Surat \"Al-`Imran.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went towards a leather skin and performed ablution in the most perfect way and then stood for the prayer. I did the same and stood beside him. The Prophet (ﷺ) put his right hand on my head, twisted my ear and then prayed two rak`at five times and then ended his prayer with witr. He laid down till the Mu'adh-dhin came then he stood up and offered two rak`at (Sunnah of Fajr prayer) and then went out and offered the Fajr prayer. (See Hadith 183)",
