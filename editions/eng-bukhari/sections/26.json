They asked, \"Shall we go to Mina and the private organs of some of us are dribbling (if we finish Ihram and have sexual relations with our wives)?\" The Prophet heard that and said, \"Had I known what I know now, I would not have brought the Hadi. If I did not have the Hadi with me I would have finished my Ihram.\" `Aisha got her menses and performed all the ceremonies (of Hajj) except the Tawaf . So when she became clean from her menses, and she had performed the Tawaf of the Ka`ba, she said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! You (people) are returning with both Hajj and `Umra and I am returning only with Hajj!\" So, he ordered `Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr to go with her to at-Tan`im. Thus she performed `Umra after the Hajj in the month of Dhi-l-Hijja. Suraqa bin Malik bin Ju'sham met the Prophet (ﷺ) at Al-`Aqaba (Jamrat-ul 'Aqaba) while the latter was stoning it and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Is this permissible only for you?\" The Prophet replied, \"No, it is for ever (i.e. it is permissible for all Muslims to perform `Umra before Hajj)",

The Prophet (ﷺ) came to me while I was weeping. He asked me the reason for it. I replied, \"I have heard of what you have said to your companions and I cannot do the `Umra.\" He asked me, \"What is the matter with you?\" I replied, \"I am not praying.\" He said, \"There is no harm in it as you are one of the daughters of Adam and the same is written for you as for others. So, you should perform Hajj and I hope that Allah will enable you to perform the `Umra as well.\" So, I carried on till we departed from Mina and halted at Al-Mahassab. The Prophet (ﷺ) called `Abdur- Rahman and said, \"Go out of the sanctuary with your sister and let her assume Ihram for `Umra, and after both of you have finished the Tawaf I will be waiting for you at this place.\" We came back at midnight and the Prophet (ﷺ) asked us, \"Have you finished?\" I replied in the affirmative. He announced the departure and the people set out for the journey and some of them had performed the Tawaf of the Ka`ba before the morning prayer, and after that the Prophet (ﷺ) set out for Medina",

So, Allah inspired the Prophet (ﷺ) divinely and he was screened by a place of cloth. I wished to see the Prophet (ﷺ) being divinely inspired. `Umar said to me, 'Come! Will you be pleased to look at the Prophet (ﷺ) while Allah is inspiring him?' I replied in the affirmative. `Umar lifted one corner of the cloth and I looked at the Prophet (ﷺ) who was snoring. (The sub-narrator thought that he said: The snoring was like that of a camel). When that state was over, the Prophet (ﷺ) asked, \"Where is the questioner who asked about `Umra? Put off your cloak and wash away the traces of Khaluq from your body and clean the Sufra (yellow color) and perform in your Umra what you perform in your Hajj (i.e. the Tawaf round the Ka`ba and the Sa`i between Safa and Marwa)",

This verse was revealed in connection with the Ansar who used to assume the Ihram for the idol Manat which was put beside a place called Qudaid and those people thought it not right to perform the Tawaf of As- Safa and Al-Marwa. When Islam came, they asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about that, and Allah revealed:-- \"Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa Are among the symbols of Allah.
