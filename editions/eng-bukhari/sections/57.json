			"text": "Narrated `Ali:I got a she-camel in my share of the war booty on the day (of the battle) of Badr, and the Prophet (ﷺ) had given me a she-camel from the Khumus. When I intended to marry Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Apostle, I had an appointment with a goldsmith from the tribe of Bani Qainuqa' to go with me to bring Idhkhir (i.e. grass of pleasant smell) and sell it to the goldsmiths and spend its price on my wedding party. I was collecting for my she-camels equipment of saddles, sacks and ropes while my two shecamels were kneeling down beside the room of an Ansari man. I returned after collecting whatever I collected, to see the humps of my two she-camels cut off and their flanks cut open and some portion of their livers was taken out. When I saw that state of my two she-camels, I could not help weeping. I asked, \"Who has done this?\" The people replied, \"Hamza bin `Abdul Muttalib who is staying with some Ansari drunks in this house.\" I went away till I reached the Prophet (ﷺ) and Zaid bin Haritha was with him. The Prophet (ﷺ) noticed on my face the effect of what I had suffered, so the Prophet (ﷺ) asked. \"What is wrong with you.\" I replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have never seen such a day as today. Hamza attacked my two she-camels, cut off their humps, and ripped open their flanks, and he is sitting there in a house in the company of some drunks.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then asked for his covering sheet, put it on, and set out walking followed by me and Zaid bin Haritha till he came to the house where Hamza was. He asked permission to enter, and they allowed him, and they were drunk. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) started rebuking Hamza for what he had done, but Hamza was drunk and his eyes were red. Hamza looked at Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and then he raised his eyes, looking at his knees, then he raised up his eyes looking at his umbilicus, and again he raised up his eyes look in at his face. Hamza then said, \"Aren't you but the slaves of my father?\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) realized that he was drunk, so Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) retreated, and we went out with him",

			"text": "Narrated Malik bin Aus:While I was at home, the sun rose high and it got hot. Suddenly the messenger of `Umar bin Al- Khattab came to me and said, \"The chief of the believers has sent for you.\" So, I went along with him till I entered the place where `Umar was sitting on a bedstead made of date-palm leaves and covered with no mattress, and he was leaning over a leather pillow. I greeted him and sat down. He said, \"O Mali! Some persons of your people who have families came to me and I have ordered that a gift should be given to them, so take it and distribute it among them.\" I said, \"O chief of the believers! I wish that you order someone else to do it.\" He said, \"O man! Take it.\" While I was sitting there with him, his doorman Yarfa' came saying, \"`Uthman, `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf, Az-Zubair and Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas are asking your permission (to see you); may I admit them?\" `Umar said, \"Yes\", So they were admitted and they came in, greeted him, and sat down. After a while Yarfa' came again and said, \"May I admit `Ali and `Abbas?\" `Umar said, \"yes.\" So, they were admitted and they came in and greeted (him) and sat down. Then `Abbas said, \"O chief of the believers! Judge between me and this (i.e. `Ali).\" They had a dispute regarding the property of Bani An-Nadir which Allah had given to His Apostle as Fai. The group (i.e. `Uthman and his companions) said, \"O chief of the believers! Judge between them and relieve both of them front each other.\" `Umar said, \"Be patient! I beseech you by Allah by Whose Permission the Heaven and the Earth exist, do you know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Our (i.e. prophets') property will not be inherited, and whatever we leave, is Sadaqa (to be used for charity),' and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) meant himself (by saying \"we'')?\" The group said, \"He said so.\" `Umar then turned to `Ali and `Abbas and said, \"I beseech you by Allah, do you know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said so?\" They replied, \" He said so.\" `Umar then said, \"So, I will talk to you about this matter. Allah bestowed on His Apostle with a special favor of something of this Fai (booty) which he gave to nobody else.\" `Umar then recited the Holy Verses: \"What Allah bestowed as (Fai) Booty on his Apostle (Muhammad) from them --- for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry: But Allah gives power to His Apostles over whomever He will 'And Allah is able to do all things.\" 9:6) `Umar added \"So this property was especially given to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), but, by Allah, neither did he take possession of it and leave your, nor did he favor himself with it to your exclusion, but he gave it to all of you and distributed it amongst you till this property remained out of it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to spend the yearly expenses of his family out of this property and used to keep the rest of its revenue to be spent on Allah 's Cause. Allah 's Apostle kept on doing this during all his lifetime. I ask you by Allah do you know this?\" They replies in the affirmative. `Umar then said to `Ali and `Abbas. \"I ask you by Allah, do you know this?\" `Umar added, \"When Allah had taken His Prophet unto Him, 'Abu Bakr said, 'I am the successor of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) so, Abu Bakr took over that property and managed it in the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to do, and Allah knows that he was true, pious and rightlyguided, and he was a follower of what was right. Then Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him and I became Abu Bakr's successor, and I kept that property in my possession for the first two years of my Caliphate, managing it in the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to do and as Abu Bakr used to do, and Allah knows that I have been true, pious, rightly guided, and a follower of what is right. Now you both (i.e. 'Ah and `Abbas) came to talk to me, bearing the same claim and presenting the same case; you, `Abbas, came to me asking for your share from your nephew's property, and this man, i.e. `Ali, came to me asking for his wife's share from her father's property. I told you both that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Our (prophets') properties are not to be inherited, but what we leave is Sadaqa (to be used for charity).' When I thought it right that I should hand over this property to you, I said to you, 'I am ready to hand over this property to you if you wish, on the condition that you would take Allah's Pledge and Convention that you would manage it in the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to, and as Abu Bakr used to do, and as I have done since I was in charge of it.' So, both of you said (to me), 'Hand it over to us,' and on that condition I handed it over to you. So, I ask you by Allah, did I hand it over to them on this condition?\" The group aid, \"Yes.\" Then `Umar faced `Ali and `Abbas saying, \"I ask you by Allah, did I hand it over to you on this condition?\" They said, \"Yes. \" He said, \" Do you want now to give a different decision? By Allah, by Whose Leave both the Heaven and the Earth exist, I will never give any decision other than that (I have already given). And if you are unable to manage it, then return it to me, and I will do the job on your behalf",

			"text": "Narrated `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair:When Az-Zubair got up during the battle of Al-Jamal, he called me and I stood up beside him, and he said to me, \"O my son! Today one will be killed either as an oppressor or as an oppressed one. I see that I will be killed as an oppressed one. My biggest worry is my debts. Do you think, if we pay the debts, there will be something left for us from our money?\" Az-Zubair added, \"O my son! Sell our property and pay my debts.\" Az-Zubair then willed one-third of his property and willed one-third of that portion to his sons; namely, `Abdullah's sons. He said, \"One-third of the one third. If any property is left after the payment of the debts, one-third (of the one-third of what is left) is to be given to your sons.\" (Hisham, a sub-narrator added, \"Some of the sons of `Abdullah were equal in age to the sons of Az-Zubair e.g. Khubaib and `Abbas. `Abdullah had nine sons and nine daughters at that time.\" (The narrator `Abdullah added:) My father (Az-Zubair) went on drawing my attention to his debts saying, \"If you should fail to pay part of the debts, appeal to my Master to help you.\" By Allah! I could not understand what he meant till I asked, \"O father! Who is your Master?\" He replied, \"Allah (is my Master).\" By Allah, whenever I had any difficulty regarding his debts, I would say, \"Master of Az-Zubair! Pay his debts on his behalf .\" and Allah would (help me to) pay it. Az-Zubair was martyred leaving no Dinar or Dirham but two pieces of land, one of which was (called) Al-Ghaba, and eleven houses in Medina, two in Basra, one in Kufa and one in Egypt. In fact, the source of the debt which he owed was, that if somebody brought some money to deposit with him. Az-Zubair would say, \"No, (i won't keep it as a trust), but I take it as a debt, for I am afraid it might be lost.\" Az-Zubair was never appointed governor or collector of the tax of Kharaj or any other similar thing, but he collected his wealth (from the war booty he gained) during the holy battles he took part in, in the company of the Prophet, Abu Bakr, `Umar, and `Uthman. (`Abdullah bin Az-Zubair added:) When I counted his debt, it turned to be two million and two hundred thousand. (The sub-narrator added:) Hakim bin Hizam met `Abdullah bin Zubair and asked, \"O my nephew! How much is the debt of my brother?\" `Abdullah kept it as a secret and said, \"One hundred thousand,\" Hakim said, \"By Allah! I don't think your property will cover it.\" On that `Abdullah said to him, \"What if it is two million and two hundred thousand?\" Hakim said, \"I don't think you can pay it; so if you are unable to pay all of it, I will help you.\" Az- Zubair had already bought Al-Ghaba for one hundred and seventy thousand. `Abdullah sold it for one million and six hundred thousand. Then he called the people saying, \"Any person who has any money claim on Az-Zubair should come to us in Al-Ghaba.\" There came to him `Abdullah bin Ja`far whom Az-Zubair owed four hundred thousand. He said to `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair, \"If you wish I will forgive you the debt.\" `Abdullah (bin Az-Zubair) said, \"No.\" Then Ibn Ja`far said, \"If you wish you can defer the payment if you should defer the payment of any debt.\" Ibn Az-Zubair said, \"No.\" `Abdullah bin Ja`far said, \"Give me a piece of the land.\" `Abdullah bin AzZubair said (to him), \"Yours is the land extending from this place to this place.\" So, `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair sold some of the property (including the houses) and paid his debt perfectly, retaining four and a half shares from the land (i.e. Al-Ghaba). He then went to Mu'awlya while `Amr bin `Uthman, Al-Mundhir bin Az- Zubair and Ibn Zam`a were sitting with him. Mu'awiya asked, \"At what price have you appraised Al- Ghaba?\" He said, \"One hundred thousand for each share,\" Muawiya asked, \"How many shares have been left?\" `Abdullah replied, \"Four and a half shares.\" Al-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair said, \"I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.\" `Amr bin `Uthman said, \"I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.\" Ibn Zam`a said, \"I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.\" Muawiya said, \"How much is left now?\" `Abdullah replied, \"One share and a half.\" Muawiya said, \"I would like to buy it for one hundred and fifty thousand.\" `Abdullah also sold his part to Muawiya six hundred thousand. When Ibn AzZubair had paid all the debts. Az-Zubair's sons said to him, \"Distribute our inheritance among us.\" He said, \"No, by Allah, I will not distribute it among you till I announce in four successive Hajj seasons, 'Would those who have money claims on Az-Zubair come so that we may pay them their debt.\" So, he started to announce that in public in every Hajj season, and when four years had elapsed, he distributed the inheritance among the inheritors. Az-Zubair had four wives, and after the one-third of his property was excluded (according to the will), each of his wives received one million and two hundred thousand. So the total amount of his property was fifty million and two hundred thousand",

Then some camels as booty were brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he asked for us saying. 'Where are the group of Al-Ash`ariyun?' Then he ordered that we should be given five camels with white humps. When we set out we said, 'What have we done? We will never be blessed (with what we have been given).' So, we returned to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, 'We asked you to provide us with means of conveyance, but you took an oath that you would not provide us with any means of conveyance.
