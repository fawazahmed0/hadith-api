He turned to the people and said:“What is wrong with one of you that he stands facing Him (meaning his Lord) and spits in front of Him? Would anyone like to be faced by someone who spits in his face? If anyone of you needs to spit, then let him spit to his left, or let him do like this in his garment.” Then Ismail (Abu Bakr bin Abu Shuaibah) showed me how he spat in his garment then rubbed it",
