It is greater before Allah then the Day of Adha and the Day of Fitr. It has five characteristics: On it Allah created Adam; on it Allah sent down Adam to this earth; on it there is a time during which a person does not ask Allah for anything but He will give it to him, so long as he does not ask for anything that is forbidden; on it the Hour will begin. There is no angel who is close to Allah, no heaven, no earth, no wind, no mountain, and no sea that does not fear Friday.’”",
