When the Imam comes out, they close their records and listen to the sermon. The first one who comes to the prayer is like one who sacrifices a camel; the one who comes after him is like one who sacrifices a cow; the one who comes after him is like one who sacrifices a ram,” (and so on) until he made mention of a hen and an egg.
