Then he stood up and went to a piece of wood in the mosque, and leaned against it. Those who were in a hurry left the mosque, saying that the prayer had been shortened. Among the people were Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, but they dared not say anything. Among the people there was also a man with long hands who was called Dhul- Yadain. He said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, has the prayer been shortened or did you forget?’ He said: ‘It has not been shortened and I did not forget.’ He said: ‘But you prayed two Rak’ah.’ He said: ‘Is what Dhul- Yadain says true?’ They said: ‘Yes.’ So he went forward and performed two Rak’ah and said the Salam, then he prostrated twice, and then he said the Salam again.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":412}}]}
