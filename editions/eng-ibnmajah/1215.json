Khirbaq, a man with big hands, stood up and called out: ‘O Messenger of Allah! Has the prayer been shortened?’ He came out angrily, dragging his lower garment, and asked about it, and was told (what had happened). So he performed the Rak’ah that he had omitted, then he said the Salam, then he prostrated twice and said the Salam again.”",
