Then refrain from praying until the sun has risen, and as long as it looks like a shield until it becomes apparent. Then pray as much as you want until a pole stands on its shadow (i.e., noon), then refrain from praying until it has crossed the zenith, for Hell is heated up at midday. Then pray as much as you want until you pray ‘Asr, then refrain from praying until the sun has set, for it sets between the two horns of Satan and it rises between the two horns of Satan.’”",
