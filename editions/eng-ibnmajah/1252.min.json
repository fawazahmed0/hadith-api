He said: ‘Yes, when you have prayed the Subh, then do not pray until the sun has risen, for it rises between the two horns of Satan. Then pray, for the prayer is attended (by the angels) and is acceptable (to Allah) until the sun is right overhead like a spear. For at that time Hell is heated up and its gates are opened. (Then refrain from prayer) until the sun passes the zenith. Then when it has passed the zenith, the prayer is attended (by the angels) and is acceptable (to Allah) until you pray the ‘Asr. Then stop praying until the sun has set.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":450}}]}
