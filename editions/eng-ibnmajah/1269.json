Send wholesome, productive rain upon all of us, sooner rather than later, beneficial and not harmful.’ No sooner had they finished performing Friday (prayer) but they were revived. Then they came to him and complained to him about the rain, saying: ‘O Allah, around us and not upon us.’ Then the clouds began to disperse right and left.”",
