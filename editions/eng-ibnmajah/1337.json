I greeted him with Salam and he said: ‘Who are you?’ So I told him, and he said: ‘Welcome, O son of my brother. I have heard that you recite Qur’an in a beautiful voice. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “This Qur’an was revealed with sorrow, so when you recite it, then weep. If you cannot weep then pretend to weep, and make your voice melodious in reciting it. Whoever does not make his voice melodious, he is not one of us.”",
