I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘Whoever performs ablution as he has been commanded, and prays as he has been commanded, will be forgiven his previous (bad) deeds.’” He said: “(Did he not say it) like that, O ‘Uqbah?” He said: “Yes.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih Lighairihi"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":594}}]}
