So they came to Sahl bin Sa’d and asked him. He said: ‘There is no one left who knows more about that than I. It is made of tamarisk (a type of tree) from Ghabah. It was made by so-and-so, the freed slave of so- and-so (a woman), (who was) a carpenter. He brought it and he (the Prophet (ﷺ)) stood on it when it was put in position. He faced the Qiblah and the people stood behind him.
