			"text": "It was narrated from Urwah bin Zubair that 'Abdullah bin Zubair told him that:A man from the Ansar had a dispute with Zubair in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) concerning a stream in the Harrah which they used to irrigate the date-palm trees. The Ansari said: \"Let the water flow\" but Zubair refused. So they referred that dispute to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who said: \"Irrigate (your land), O Zubair., and then let the water flow to your neighbor.\" The Ansari became angry and said \"O Messenger of Allah, is it because he is your cousin?\" The face of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) changed color (because of anger) and he said: \"O Zubair, irrigate (your land) then block the water until it flows back to the walls around the date-palm trees.\" Zubair said: \"By Allah, I think that this verse was revealed concerning this matter. ' But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission",
