(O Allah, send blessing upon him, forgive him, have mercy on him, keep him safe and sound, and pardon him; wash him with water and snow and hail, and cleanse him of sins just as a white garment is cleansed of dirt. Give him in exchange for his house that is better than his house, and a family that is better than his family. Protect him from the trial of the grave and the torment of the Fire).’”",
