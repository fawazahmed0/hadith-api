The Prophet (ﷺ) came out and I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, this man is showing off.’ Then he died in Al-Madinah, and they finished preparing him, then they carried his dead body. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘Be gentle with him, may Allah be gentle with him, for he loved Allah and His Messenger.’ Then his grave was dug and he (the Prophet (ﷺ)) said: ‘Make it spacious for him, and may Allah make it spacious for him.’ Some of his Companions said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, you are grieving for him.’ He said: ‘Yes indeed, for he loved Allah and His Messenger.’”",
