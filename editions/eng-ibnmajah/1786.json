And cattle and sheep will come and trample at their owners with their hooves and butt them with their horns, And hoarded treasure will come in the form of a bald-headed snale, and will meet its owner on the Day of Resurrection. Its owner will flee from it two time, then it will come to him and he will flee again, and will say: 'What do I have to do with you?' and it will say: 'I am your hoarded treasure, I am your hoarded treasure.' He will try to shield himself with this hand and it will devour it.”",
