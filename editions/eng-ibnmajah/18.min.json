He saw people trading pieces of gold for Dinar and pieces of silver for Dirham. He said: \"O people, you are consuming Riba (usury)! For I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: 'Do not sell gold for gold unless it is like for like; there should be no increase and no delay (between the two transactions).'\" Mu'awiyah said to him: \"O Abu Walid, I do not think there is any Riba involved in this , except in cases where there is a delay.\" 'Ubadah said to him: \"I tell you a Hadith from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and you tell me your opinion!

'Umar said: \"Go back to your land, O Abu Walid, for what a bad land is the land from where you and people like you are absent.\" Then he wrote to Mu'awiyah and said: \"You have no authority over him; make the people follow what he says , for he is right","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih Hadith"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":18}}]}
