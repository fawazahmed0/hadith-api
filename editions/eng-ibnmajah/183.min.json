He said: 'I heard the Messenger of Allah say: 'On the Day of Resurrection, the believer will be brought close to his Lord until He will cover him with His screen, then He will make him confess his sins. He will ask him: \"Do you confess?\" He will say: \"O Lord, I confess.\" This will continue as long as Allah wills, then He will say: \"I concealed them for you in the world, and I forgive you for them today.\" Then he will be given the scroll of his good deeds, or his record, in his right hand. But as for the disbeliever or the hypocrite, (his sins) will be announced before the witnesses.' \" (One of the narrators) Khalid said: \"At: 'before the witnesses' there is something missing.\" \"These are the ones who lied against their Lord!' No doubt! The curse of Allah is on the wrongdoers","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":183}}]}
