He said: 'I went to Sham and saw them prostrating to their bishops and patricians and I wanted to do that for you.' The messenger of Allah said: 'Do not do that. If I were to command anyone to prostrate to anyone other than Allah, I would have commanded women to prostrate to their husbands. By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad! No woman can fulfill her duty towards Allah until she fulfills her duty towards her husband. If he asks her (for intimacy) even if she is on her camel saddle, she should not refuse.' ”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih Lighairihi"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":9,"hadith":9}}]}
