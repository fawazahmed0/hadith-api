Then Muawiyah, Abu Jahm bin Sukhair and Usamah bin Zaid proposed marriage to her. The Messenger of Allah said: 'As for Muawiyah, he is a poor man who has no money. As from Abu Jahm he is a man who habitually beats woman. But Usamah (is good).' She gestured with her hand, saying: 'Usamah, Usamah!?' The Messenger of Allah said to her: 'Obedience to Allah and obedience to His Messenger is better for you.' She said: 'So I married him and I was pleased with him.' ”",
