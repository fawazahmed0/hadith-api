Then she said: 'O Messenger of Allah, is it enough for you that the young daughter of Abu Bakr waves her hands in front of you?' Then she turned to me, but I ignored her until the Prophet said: 'You should say something to defend yourself.' So I turned on her, (and replied to her) until I saw that her mouth had become dry, and she did not say anything back to me. And I saw the Prophet with his face shining.\" (Hasan)",
