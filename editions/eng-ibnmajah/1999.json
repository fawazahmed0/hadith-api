			"text": "Ali bin Husain said that Miswar bin Makhramah told him that:'Ali bin Abu Talib proposed to the daughter of Abu Jahl, when he was married to Fatimah the daughter of the Prophet. When Fatimah heard of that she went to the Prophet, and said: \"Your people are saying that you do not feel angry for your daughters. This 'Ali is going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl.\" Miswar said: \"The Prophet stood up, and I heard him when he bore witness (i.e., said the Shahadah), then he said: 'I married my daughter (Zainab) to Abul-As bin Rabi', and he spoke to me and was speaking the truth. Fatimah bint Muhammad is a part of me, and I hate to see her faced with troubles. By Allah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah and the daughter of the enemy of Allah will never be joined together in marriage to one man.\" He said: So, 'Ali abandoned the marriage proposal",
