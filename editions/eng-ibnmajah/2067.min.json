The Prophet said: \"Bring proof or you will feel the Hadd (punishment) on your back.\" Hilal bin Umayyah said: \"By the One Who sent you with the truth, I am telling the truth, and Allah will send down revelation concerning my situation which will spare my back.\" Then the following was revealed: \"And for those who accuse their wives, but have no witnesses except themselves, let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies (i.e., testifies four times) by Allah that he is one of those who speak the truth. And the fifth (testimony should be) the invoking of the curse of Allah on him if he be of those who tell a lie (against her). But it shall avert the punishment (of stoning to death) from her, it she bears witness four times by Allah, that he (her husband) is telling a lie. And the fifth (testimony) should be that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he (her husband) speaks the truth.\" The Prophet (ﷺ), turned and sent for them, and they came. Hilal bin Umayyah stood up and bore witness, and the Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"Allah knows that one of you is lying. Will either of you repent?\" Then she stood up and affirmed her innocence.

Then she said: 'By Allah, I cannot dishonor my people for ever.' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Wait and see. If she gives birth to a child with black eyes, fleshy buttocks and big calves, then he is the son of Sharik bin Sahma'.' And she gave birth to such a child.
