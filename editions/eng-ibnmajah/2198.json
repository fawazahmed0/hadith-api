			"text": "It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that :a man from among the Ansar came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and begged from him. He said, \"Do you have anything in your house?\" He said: \"Yes, a blanket, part of which we cover ourselves with and part we spread beneath us, and a bowl from which we drink water.\" He said: \"Givethem to me.\" So he brought them to him, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took them in his hand and said, \"Who will by these two things?\" A man said: \"I will by them for one Dirham.\" He said: \"Who will offer more than a Dirham?\" two or three times. A man said: \"I will buy them for two Dirham.\" So he gave them to him and took the two Dirham, which he gave to the Ansari and said: \"Buy food with one of them and give it to your family, and buy an axe with the other and bring it to me.\" So he did that, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took it and fixed a handle to it, and said: \"Go and gather firewood, and I do not want to see you for fifteen days.\" So he went and gathered firewood and sold it, then he came back, and he had earned ten Dirham. (The Prophet (ﷺ)) said: \"Buy food with some of it and clothes with some.\" Then he said: \"This is better for you than coming with begging (appearing) as a spot on your face on the Day of Resurrection. Begging is only appropriate for one who is extremely poor or who is in severe debt, or one who must pay painful blood money.”[1]",
