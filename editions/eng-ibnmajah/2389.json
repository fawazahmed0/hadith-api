The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to her: “It is not permissible for a woman to dispose of her wealth without her husband's permission. Did you ask Ka'b's permission?” She said: “Yes.” So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent for Ka'b bin Malik, her husband, and said, “Did you give Khairah permission to give her jewelry in charity?” He said: “Yes.” So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) accepted it from her",
