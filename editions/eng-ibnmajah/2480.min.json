The Ansari said: “Let the water flow,” but he refused. So they referred their dispute to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Irrigate (your trees) O Zubair, then let the water flow to your neighbor.” The Ansari became angry and said: “O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), is it because he is your cousin (son of your paternal aunt)?” The expression of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) changed, then he said: “O Zubair, irrigate (your trees) then retain the water until it reaches the walls.” Zubair said: “I think this Verse was revealed concerning that: “But no, by your Lord, they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission [1].'” (Sahih) [1] An-Nisa 4","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":16,"hadith":45}}]}
