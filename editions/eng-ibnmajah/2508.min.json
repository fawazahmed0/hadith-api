People used to go out to relieve themselves only every two or three days, and their faces was like that of a camel (because of hunger and rough food). Then he entered a ruin and while he was squatting to relieve himself, he saw a rat bringing a Dinar out of a hole, then it went in and brought out another, until it had brought out seventeen Dinars. Then it brought out a piece of red rag.Miqdad said: “I picked up the rag and found another Dinar inside it, thus completing eighteen Dinar. I took them out and brought them to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and told him what had happened. I said, 'Take its Sadaqah (charity), O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).' He said: 'Take them back, for no Sadaqah is due on them. May Allah (SWT) bless them for you.' Then he said: 'Perhaps you put your hand in the hole?' I said: 'No, by the One Who has honored you with the truth.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":18,"hadith":7}}]}
