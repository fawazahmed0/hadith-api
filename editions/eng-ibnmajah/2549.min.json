His opponent, who was more knowledgeable than him, said: 'Judge between us according to the Book of Allah (SWT), but let me speak first.' He said: 'Speak.' He said: 'My son was a servant of this man, and he committed adultery with his wife, and I ransomed him for one hundred sheep and a servant. I asked some men of knowledge and I was told that my son should be given one hundred lashes and exiled for a year, and that the wife of this man should be stoned.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, I will judge between you according to the Book of Allah (SWT). The one hundred sheep and the servant are to be returned to you and your son is to be given one hundred lashes and exiled for a year. Go tomorrow, O Unais, to the wife of this man and if she admits I then stone her.'”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":20,"hadith":17}}]}
