He said: 'I have committed fornication,' and he turned away from him. Then, he said: I have committed fornication, and he turned away from him, until when he had confessed four times, he ordered that he should be stoned. When he was being struck with the stones, he ran away, but a man caught up with him who had a camel's jawbone in his hand; he struck him and he fell down. The Prophet (ﷺ) was told about how he fled when the stones hit him and he said: 'Why did you not let him be?'”",
