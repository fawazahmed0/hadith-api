What (is taken) from the place where dates are dried, (the penalty) is cutting off the hand if the amount taken is equal to the price of a shield. But if (the person) eats it and does not take it away, there is no penalty.” He said: “What about the sheep taken from the pasture, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?” He said: “(The thief) must pay double its price and be punished, and if it was in the pen then his hand should be cut off, if what was taken was worth the price of a shield.”",
