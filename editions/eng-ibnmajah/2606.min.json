Or should I say I saw such and such, and you will carry out the legal punishment punishment on me (for slander) and never accept my testimony thereafter?'

Then he said: 'No (on second thought) I am afraid that the drunkard and the jealous would pursue that.” (Da'if) Abu Abdullah - meaning Ibn Majah - said: “I heard Abu Zurah saying: “This is a Hadith of Ali bin Muhammad At-Tanafisi, I did not hear it from him.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":20,"hadith":74}}]}
