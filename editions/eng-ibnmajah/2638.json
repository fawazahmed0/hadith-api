			"text": "It was narrated from 'Aishah that :the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent Abu Jahm bin Hudhaifah to collect Sadaqah. A man disputed with him concerning his Sadaqah, and Abu Jahm struck him and wounded his head. They came to Prophet (ﷺ) and said: “Compensatory money, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)!” The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “You will have such and such,” but they did not accept that. He said: “You will have such and such,” and they agreed. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said: “I am going to address the people and tell them that you agreed.” They said: “Yes.” So the Prophet (ﷺ) addressed (the people) and said: “These people of Laith came to me seeking compensatory money, and I have offered them such and such. Do you agree?” They said: “No.” The Emigrants wanted to attack them, but the Prophet (ﷺ) told them not to, so they refrained. Then he called them and offered them more and said: “Do you agree?” They said: “Yes.” He said: “I am going to address the people and tell them that you agreed.” They said: “Yes.” So the Prophet (ﷺ) addressed (the people) then said: “Do you Agree?” They said: “Yes.”",
