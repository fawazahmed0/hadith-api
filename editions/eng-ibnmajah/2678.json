'Abdullah was attacked and killed, and mention of that was made to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: “Will you swear an oath and establish your right to blood money?” They said: “O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), how can we swear an oath when we did not witness anything?” He said: “Do you want the Jews to swear that they are innocent?” They said: “O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), then they will kill us too.” So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) paid the blood money himself",
