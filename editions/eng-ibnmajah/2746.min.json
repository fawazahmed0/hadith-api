Whatever inheritance he finds has not yet been distributed, he will have a share of it. But he cannot be named after his father if the man whom he claimed as his father did not acknowledge him. If he as born to a slave woman whom his father did not own, or to a free woman with whom he committed adultery, then he cannot be named after him and he does not inherit from him, even if the one whom he claims as his father acknowledges him. So he is an illegitimate child who belongs to his mother’s people, whoever they are, whether she is a free woman or a slave.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":23,"hadith":28}}]}
