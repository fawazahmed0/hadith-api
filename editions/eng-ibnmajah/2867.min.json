On what basis shall we give this pledge?’ He said: ‘(On the basis that) you will worship Allah and not associate anything with Him, you will establish the five daily prayers, you will listen and obey’ – then he spoke some words under his breath – ‘and you will not ask the people for anything.’ He said: ‘I saw some of that group.
