			"text": "It was narrated from Ibrahim bin ‘Abdullah bin Hunain, from his father, that ‘Abdullah bin ‘Abbas and Miswar bin Makhramah disagreed at Abwa’. Abdullah bin ‘Abbas said that the Muhrim may wash his head, and Miswar said that the Muhrim may not wash his head. Ibn ‘Abbas sent me to Abu Ayyub Al-Ansari to ask him about that, and I found him taking a bath near the well, screened with a piece of cloth. I greeted him with Salam, and he said:“Who is this?” I said: “I am ‘Abdullah bin Hunain. ‘Abdullah bin ‘Abbas sent me to you to ask you how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to wash his head when he was in Ihram.” He said: “Abu Ayyub put his hand on the cloth and lowered it until his head appeared, then he said to someone who was pouring water for him, Pour water. So he poured water on his head. Then he rubbed his head with his hands, forwards and backwards, and said: ‘This is what I saw him (ﷺ) doing.’”",
