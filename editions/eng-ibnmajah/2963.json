The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered upon me when I was weeping. He said: ‘What is the matter with you? Have your menses come?’ I said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘This is something that Allah has decreed for the daughters of Adam. Do all the rites, but do not circumambulate the House.’” She said: “And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sacrificed a cow on behalf of his wives.”",
