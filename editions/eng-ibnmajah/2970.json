Salman bin Rabi’ah and Zaid bin Suhan heard me when I was entering Ihram for them both together at Qadisiyyah. They said: ‘This man is more lost than his camel!’ It was as if they had heaped a mountain on me with their words. I went to ‘Umar bin Khattab and told him about that. He turned to them and reproached them, then he turned to me and said: ‘You have been guided to the Sunnah of the Prophet (ﷺ), you have been guided to the Sunnah of the Prophet (ﷺ).’” Another chain reports a similar narration",
