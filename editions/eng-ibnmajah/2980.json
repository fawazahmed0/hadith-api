			"text": "It was narrated that Jabir bin ‘Abdullah said:“We began our Talbiyah for Hajj only with Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ), and we did not mix it with ‘Umrah. We arrived in Makkah when four nights of Dhul-Hijjah had passed, and when we had performed Tawaf around the Ka’bah and Sa’y between Safa and Marwah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded us to make it ‘Umrah, and to come out of Ihram and have relations with our wives. We said: ‘There are only five (days) until ‘Arafah. Will we g out to it with our male organs dripping with semen?’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘I am the most righteous and truthful among you, and were it not for the sacrificial animal, I would have exited Ihram.’ Suraqah bin Malik said: ‘Is this Tamattu’ for this year only or forever?’ He said: ‘No, it is forever and ever.’”",
