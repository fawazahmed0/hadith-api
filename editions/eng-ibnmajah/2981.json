When we came close, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered that whoever did not have a sacrificial animal, then he should exit the Ihram. So all the people exited Ihram, except those who had the sacrificial animal. When the Day of Sacrifice i.e., the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah) came, some beef was brought to us, and it was said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has offered a sacrifice on behalf of his wives.’”",
