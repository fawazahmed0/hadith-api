When we came to Makkah, he said: ‘Make your Hajj (to) ‘Umrah.’ The people said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, we have entered Ihram for Hajj, how can we make it ‘Umrah?’ He said: ‘Look at what I command you to do, and do it.’ They repeated their question and he got angry and went away. Then he entered upon ‘Aishah angry and she saw anger in his face, and said: ‘Who has made you angry? May Allah vex him!’ He said: ‘Why should I not get angry, when I give a command and it is not obeyed?’”",
