The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘Whoever has a sacrificial animal with him, let him remain in Ihram. Whoever does not have a sacrificial animal with him, let him exit Ihram.’ She said: ‘I did not have a sacrificial animal with me, so I exited Ihram, but Zubair had a sacrificial animal with him, so he did not exit Ihram. So I put on my regular clothes and came to Zubair, and he said: ‘Go away from me.’ I said: ‘Are you afraid I am going to jump on you?!’”",
