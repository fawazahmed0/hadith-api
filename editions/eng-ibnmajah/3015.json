Whoever comes before Fajr prayer on the night of Jam’, he has completed his Hajj. The days at Mina are three. ‘But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him and whosoever stays on, there is no sin on him.’” [2:203] Then he seated a man behind him on his mount and he started calling out these words.’” Another chain reports a similar hadith",
