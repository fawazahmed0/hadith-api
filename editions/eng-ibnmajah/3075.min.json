Some of us began the Talbiyah for Hajj and ‘Umrah together, some of us began the Talbiyah for Hajj on its own, and some of us began the Talbiyah for ‘Umrah on its own. Those who began the Talbiyah for Hajj and ‘Umrah together did not exit Ihram at all until they had completed the rites of Hajj. Those who began the Talbiyah for Hajj on its own did not exit ihram at all until they had completed the rites of Hajj. And those who began the Talbiyah for ‘Umrah on its own circumambulated the House and ran between Safa and Marwah, then whatever had been forbidden to them became permissible until the time for Hajj came.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Isnaad"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Hasan Isnaad"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":25,"hadith":194}}]}
