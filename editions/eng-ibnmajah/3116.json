I handed it (the money) to him and he said: ‘Is this yours?’ I said: ‘No, if it were mine I would not have given it to you.’ He said: ‘Since you say that, ‘Umar was sitting in the place where you are sitting now and said: “I will not go out until I distribute the wealth of the poor Muslims.” I said: “You will not do that.” He said: “I will certainly do that.” He said: “Why is that?” I said: “Because, the Prophet (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr saw where it was, and they had more need of the money than you do. But, they did not move it. Then, he stood up just as he was and went out.”",
