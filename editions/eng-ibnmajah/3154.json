He said: ‘Who is this who has slaughtered?’ A man from among us came out and said: ‘It is me, O Messenger of Allah, I slaughtered before the prayer so that I could feed my family and neighbors.’ He commanded him to repeat it. He said: ‘No, by the One besides Whom there is none worthy of worship, I do not have anything but a one-year-old sheep or a lamb.’ He (ﷺ) said: ‘Sacrifice it, but a one-year-old sheep will not do for anyone after you.’”",
