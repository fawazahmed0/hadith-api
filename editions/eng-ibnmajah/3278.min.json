He picked it up, removed whatever dirt had gotten onto it, and ate it. The villagers and farmers winked at one another (finding it odd) and it was said: ‘May Allah help the chief! These villagers and farmers are winking at one another because you picked up a morsel (from the ground) when you have this food in front of you.’ He said: ‘I am not going to give up something I heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for these non- Arabs. We were told, if one of us dropped a morsel of food, to pick it up, remove whatever dirt was on it, and eat it, and not to leave it for Satan.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":29,"hadith":28}}]}
