Then she said: ‘Go to the Prophet (ﷺ) and invite him (to come and eat).’ So I went and told him: ‘My mother is inviting you (to come and eat).’ So he stood up, and said to the people who were with him: ‘Get up.’ I went ahead of him and told her. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) came and said: ‘Bring what you have made.’ She said: ‘I only made it for you alone.’ He said: ‘Bring it.’ Then he said: ‘O Anas, bring (them) in to me ten by ten.’ So I kept bringing them in ten by ten, and they ate their fill, and there were eighty of them.”",
