			"text": "It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said that ‘Umar entered upon him when he was eating, and he made room for him in the middle of the gathering. He said:Bismillah, then he took a morsel and ate it, then a second. Then he said: “I notice some fat in the food but it is not the fat of the meat.” ‘Abdullah said: “O Commander of the Believers! I went out to the marketplace looking for some fatty meat (bones with plenty of meat on them) to buy, but it was expensive, so I bought some lean meat (bones with not much meat on them) for a Dirham, and added a Dirham’s worth of ghee. I wanted my family to go through it bone by bone.” ‘Umar said: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) never had these two things together; he would eat one and give the other in charity.”",
