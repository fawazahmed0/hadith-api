			"text": "It was narrated from ‘Asim bin Muhammad bin Zaid bin ‘Abdullah, from his father, that his grandfather said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade us to drink while (lying) on our bellies, lapping up water, and he forbade us to drink from one hand only. He said: ‘None of you should lap up water as a dog does, and he should not drink water from one hand as the people with whom Allah is angry do, and he should not drink from a vessel at night without stirring it first, unless the vessel was covered. Whoever drinks from his hand when he is able to drink from a vessel, with the intention of humility, Allah will record good deeds equivalent to the number of fingers for him. It (i.e., the hand) is the vessel of ‘Eisa bin Maryam, (as) when he threw away the cup and said: ‘Ugh! That belongs to this world.’”",
