			"text": "It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“A Jew from among the Jews of Bani Zuraiq, whose name was Labid bin A’sam, cast a spell on the Prophet (ﷺ), and the Prophet (ﷺ) began to imagine that he had done something when he had not. One day, or one night, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) supplicated, and then supplicated again. Then he said: ‘O ‘Aishah, do you know that Allah has instructed me concerning the matter I asked Him about? Two men came to me, and one of them sat at my head and the other at my feet. The one at my head said to the one at my feet, or the one at my feet said to the one at my head \"what is ailing this man ?\" He said: “He has been affected by a spell.” He said: “Who cast the spell on him?” He said: “Labid bin A’sam.” He said: “With what?” He said: “With a comb and the hairs stuck to it, and the spathe of a male date palm.” He said: “Where is that?” He said: “In the well of Dhu Arwan.” She said: “So the Prophet (ﷺ) went to it, with a group of his Companions, then he came and said: ‘By Allah. O ‘Aishah. It was as if its water was infused with henna and its date palms were like the heads of devils.’” She said: “I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, why don’t you burn them?’ He said: ‘As for me, Allah has healed me, and I do not like to let evil spread among the people.’ Then he issued orders that the well be filled up with earth.”",
