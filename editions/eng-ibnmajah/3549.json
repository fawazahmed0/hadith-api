			"text": "It was narrated from ‘Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Laila that his father Abu Laila said:“I was sitting with the Prophet (ﷺ) when a Bedouin came to him and said: ‘I have a brother who is sick.’ He said: ‘What is the matter with your brother?’ He said: ‘He suffers from a slight mental derangement.’ He said: ‘Go and bring him.’” He said: “(So he went) and he brought him. He made him sit down in front of him and I heard him seeking refuge for him with Fatihatil-Kitab; four Verses from the beginning of Al-Baqarah, two Verses from its middle: ‘And your Ilah (God) is One Ilah (God – Allah),’ [2:163] and Ayat Al-Kursi; and three Verses from its end; a Verse from Al ‘Imran, I think it was: ‘Allah bears witness that La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He),’ [3:18] a Verse from Al-A’raf: ‘Indeed, your Lord is Allah,’ [7:54] a Verse from Al-Mu’minun: ‘And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allah, any other ilah (god), of whom he has no proof,’[23:117] a Verse from Al-Jinn: ‘And He, exalted is the Majesty of our Lord,’ [72:3] ten Verses from the beginning of As-Saffat; three Verses from the end of Al-Hashr; (then) ‘Say: He is Allah, (the) One,’ [112:1] and Al-Mu’awwidhatain. Then the Bedouin stood up, healed, and there was nothing wrong with him.”",
