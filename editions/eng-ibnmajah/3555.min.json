He came out to us wearing it as a lower wrap. So-and-so the son of so-and-so.” – a man whose name he told that day – said: “O Messenger of Allah, how beautiful this sheet is! Let me wear it.” He said: “Yes.” When he went inside he folded it up and sent it to him. The people said to him: “By Allah, you have not done well. The Prophet (ﷺ) wore it because he needed it, then you asked for it, and you knew that he would not refuse anyone who asked him for something.” He said: “By Allah, I did not ask for it so that I could wear it, rather I asked for it so that it could be my shroud.” Sahl said: “And it became his shroud the day he died.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":32,"hadith":6}}]}
