And you must beware of lying for with it comes immorality, and they both lead to Hell. Ask Allah for Al-Mu'afah, for no one is given anything after certainty that is better than Mu'afah. Do not envy one another, do not hate one another, do not sever ties with one another, do not turn your backs on one another and be, O slaves of Allah, brothers",
