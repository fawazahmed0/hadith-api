If he says Bismillah (in the Name of Allah) they say: ‘You have been guided.’ If he says La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah (there is no power and no strength except with Allah), they say: ‘You are protected.’ If he says, Tawwakaltu ‘ala Allah (I have my trust in Allah), they say: ‘You have been taken care of.’ Then his two Qarins (satans) come to him and they (the two angels) say: ‘What do you want with a man who has been guided, protected and taken care of?’”",
