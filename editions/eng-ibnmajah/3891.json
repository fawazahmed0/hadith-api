			"text": "It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“If the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw a cloud that looked as if it was bringing rain, the color of his face would change, and he would go in and out and walk to and fro. Then, if it rained, he would feel relieved.” ‘Aishah mentioned to him what she had seen him do, and he said: “How do you know? Perhaps it would be as the people of Hud said: ‘Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud coming towards their valleys, they said: “This is a cloud bringing us rain!” Nay, but it is that (torment) which you were asking to be hastened.” [46:24]",
