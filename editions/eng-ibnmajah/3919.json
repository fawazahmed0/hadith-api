			"text": "It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said:“I was a young unmarried man at the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and I used to stay overnight in the mosque. If any of us had seen a dream, he would tell it to the Prophet (ﷺ). I said: ‘O Allah, if there is any good in me before You, show me a dream that the Prophet (ﷺ) can interpret for me.’ So I went to sleep and I saw two angels who came to me and took me away. They were met by another angel who said: ‘Do not be alarmed,’ and they took me to Hell which was built like a well. In it were people, some of whom I recognized. Then they took me off to the right. In the morning I mentioned that to Hafsah, and Hafsah said that she told the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about it, and he said: ‘Abdullah is a righteous man, if only he would pray more at night.’”",
