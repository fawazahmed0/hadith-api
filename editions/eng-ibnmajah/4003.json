			"text": "It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“O women, give in charity and pray a great deal for forgiveness, for I have seen that you form the majority of the people of Hell.” A woman who was very wise said: “Why is it, O Messenger of Allah, that we form the majority of the people of Hell?” He said: “You curse a great deal and you are ungrateful to your husbands, and I have never seen anyone lacking in discernment and religion more overwhelming to a man of wisdom than you.” She said: “O Messenger of Allah, what is this lacking in discernment and religion?” He said: “The lack of discernment is the fact that the testimony of two women is equal to the testimony of one man; this is the lack of reason. And (a woman) spends several nights when she does not pray, and she does not fast in Ramadhan, and this is the lack in religion.”",
