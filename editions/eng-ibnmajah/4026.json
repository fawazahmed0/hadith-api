Show me how You give life to the dead.’ He (Allah) said: ‘Do you not believe?’ He (Ibrahim) said: ‘Yes (I believe), but to be stronger in Faith.’[2:260] And may Allah have mercy on Lut. He wished to have a powerful support. And if i were to stay in prison as long as Yusuf stayed, I would have accepted the offer.’”",
