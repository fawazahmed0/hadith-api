They will conquer Constantinople with Tasbih and Takbir and will acquire such spoils of war as has never been seen before, which they will distribute by the shieldful. Someone will come and say: “Masih has appeared in your land!” But he will be lying, so the one who takes (some of the spoils) will regret it, and the one who leaves it behind will regret it too.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Mawdu"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Mawdu"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":170}}]}
