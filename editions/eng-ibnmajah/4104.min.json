Sa’d said to him: ‘Why are you weeping, my brother? Are you not a Companion of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? Are you not? Are you not?’ Salman said: ‘I am only weeping for one reason: I am not weeping because of longing for this world or for dislike of the Hereafter. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave me some advice and I think that I have transgressed.’ He said: ‘What was his advice to you?’ He said: ‘He advised me that something like the provision of a rider is sufficient for anyone of you, and I think that I have transgressed that. As for you, O Sa’d, fear Allah when you pass a verdict, and when you distribute (spoils of war), and when you decide to do anything.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":5}}]}
