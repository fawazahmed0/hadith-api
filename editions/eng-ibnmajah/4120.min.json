We say: He is one of the noblest of people. If he proposes marriage, his proposal deserves to be accepted; and if he intercedes, his intercession deserves to be accepted; and if he speaks, he deserves to be listened to.’ The Prophet (ﷺ) remained silent, and another man passed by. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘What do you think about this man?’ We said: ‘By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, this is one of the poor Muslims. If he proposes marriage, he does not deserve to get married; and if he intercedes, his intercession does not deserve to be accepted; and if he speaks, he does not deserve to be listened to.’ The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘This one is better than an earthful of (men like) the other man.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":21}}]}
