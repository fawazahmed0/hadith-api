			"text": "It was narrated from Khabbab, concerning the Verse:“And turn not away those who invoke their Lord, morning and afternoon...” up to His saying: “...and thus become of the unjust.” [6:52] He said: “Aqra’ bin Habis At-Tamimi and ‘Uyainah bin Hisn Al-Fazri came and found the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with Suhaib, Bilal, ‘Ammar and Khabbab, sitting with some of the believers who were weak (i.e., socially). When they saw them around the Prophet (ﷺ) they looked down on them. They took him aside and said: ‘We want you to sit with us along, so that the ‘Arabs will recognize our superiority. If the delegations of the Arabs come to you we will feel ashamed if the Arabs see us with these slaves. So, when we come to you, make them get up from your presence, then when we have finished, sit with them if you wish.’ He said: ‘Yes.’ They said: ‘Write a document for us (binding you to that).’ So he called for a piece of paper and he called ‘Ali to write, and we were sitting in a corner. Then Jibra’il (as), came down and said: “And turn not away those who invoke their Lord, morning and afternoon seeking His Face. You are accountable for them in nothing, and they are accountable for you in nothing, that you may turn them away, and thus become of the unjust.” [6:52] Then he mentioned Aqra’ bin Habis and ‘Uyaynah bin Hisn, then he said: “Thus We have tried some of them with others, that they might say: ‘Is it these (poor believers) whom Allah has favored from amongst us?’ Does not Allah know best those who are grateful.” [6:53] Then he said: “When those who believe in Our Ayat come to you, say: Salamun ‘Alaykum (peace be on you); your Lord has written (prescribed) mercy for Himself”.” [6:54] He said: “Then we got so close to him that our knees were touching his, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting with us. When he wanted to get up, he stood up and left us. Then Allah revealed: “And keep yourself patiently with those who call on their Lord morning and afternoon, seeking His Face; and let not your eyes overlook them,” – and do not sit with the nobles – “desiring the pomp and glitter of the life of the world; and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance,” – meaning ‘Uyainah and Aqra’ – “and who follows his own lusts, and those affair (deeds) has been lost” [18:28] He said: ‘May they be doomed.’ He said: ‘May ‘Uyainah and Aqra’ be doomed.’ Then he made the parable for them of two men and the parable of this world. Khabbab said: “We used to sit with the Prophet (ﷺ) and if the time came for him to leave, we would get up and leave him, then he would leave.”",
