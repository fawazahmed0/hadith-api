Then he sent me to another man, who sent a she-camel to him. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw it, he said: ‘O Allah, bless it and bless the one who sent it.’” Nuqadah said: \"I said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): 'And for the one who brought it.' He said: 'And (bless) the one who brought it.' Then he ordered that it should be milked and it yielded plenty of milk. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'O Allah, increase the wealth of so-and-so,' meaning the first one who did not give a camel; 'and give so-and-so provision day by day,' meaning the one who had sent the she-camel",
