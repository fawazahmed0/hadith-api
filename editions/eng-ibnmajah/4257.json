			"text": "It was narrated from Abu Dharr that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Allah the Blessed and Exalted says: ‘O My slaves, all of you are sinners except those whom I have saved. So ask Me for forgiveness, I will forgive you. Whoever among you knows that I have the power to forgive and asks Me to forgive by My power, I will forgive him. All of you are astray except those whom I guide. Ask Me for guidance and I will guide you. All of you are poor except those whom I enrich (make independent of means). Ask of Me and I will grant you provision. Even if your living and your dead, your first and your last, your fresh and your dry, were all as pious as the most pious among My slaves, that would not increase my dominion as much as a gnat’s wing, and if they were to be as evil as the most evil among My slaves, that would not detract from My dominion as much as a gnat’s wing. Even if your living and your dead, your first and your last, your fresh and your dry, were to join together and each of them were to ask for all that he wishes for, that would only detract from My dominion as much as if one of you were to pass by the edge of the sea and dip a needle in it and withdraw it. That is because I am the Most Generous, Majestic. I give with a word; when I will something, all I do is say to it “Be!” – and it is.’”",
