By the Lord of the Ka’bah, it is sparkling light, sweet basil waving in the breeze, a lofty palace, a flowing river, abundant ripe fruit, a beautiful wife and many fine garments, in a palace of eternal abode, in ease and luxury, in beautiful, strongly-built, lofty houses.’ They said: ‘We will strive heard for it, O Messenger of Allah.’ He said: ‘Say: In sha’ Allah (if Allah wills).’ Then he mentioned Jihad and encouraged them to engage in it.”",
