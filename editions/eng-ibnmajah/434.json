Then he raised his mouth and sniffed water up into his nostrils three times. Then he washed his face three times and his arms up to his elbows twice. Then he wiped his head with his hands, from front to back. He started at the front of his head, then went with them to the nape of his neck, then he brought them back, returning them to the place he started, then he washed his feet",
