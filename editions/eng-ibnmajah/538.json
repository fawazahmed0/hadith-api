He had a nocturnal emission on it, and he felt too shy to send it back to send it back to her when it had the traces of that emission on it, so he dipped it in water and then sent it to her. 'Aishah said: 'Why did he spoil our garment? It would have been sufficient for him to scrape it off with his finger. I often scraped it (semen) from the garment of the Messenger of Allah with my finger",
