(O Allah, I ask You by the right that those who ask of You have over You, and I ask by virtue of this walking of mine, for I am not going out because of pride or vanity, or to show off or make a reputation, rather I am going out because I fear Your wrath and seek Your pleasure. So I ask You to protect me from the Fire and to forgive me my sins, for no one can forgive sins except You),' Allah will turn His Face towards him and seventy thousand angels will pray for his forgiveness","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":4,"hadith":44}}]}
