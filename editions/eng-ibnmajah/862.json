When he stood up for prayer, he stood up straight and raised his hands until they were parallel to his shoulders, then he said: Allahu Akbar. When he wanted to bow in Ruku`, he raised his hands until they were parallel to his shoulders. When he said Sami` Allahu liman hamidah (Allah hears those who praise Him), he raised his hands and stood up straight. When he stood up after two Rak`ah, he said Allahu Akbar and raised his hands until they were parallel to his shoulders, as he did when he started the prayer.’”",
