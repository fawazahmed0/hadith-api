My father said to me: ‘Stay with your lambs until I go to those people and see what they want.’ He said: Then he (my father) went out and I came, (i.e., I came near,) then there was the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and the time for prayer came so I prayed with them, and I was looking at the whiteness of the armpits of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) every time he prostrated.” Ibn Majah said: The people say `Ubaidullah bin `Abdullah, but Abu Bakr bin Abu Shaibah said: \"The people say `Abdullah bin `Ubaidullah.\" Muhammad bin Bashshar said: \"`Abdur-Rahman bin Mahdi, Safwan bin `Eisa and Abu Dawud all said: 'Dawud bin Qais narrated to us, from `Ubaidullah bin `Abdullah bin Aqram, from his father, from the Prophet (ﷺ).'\" With similar wording",
