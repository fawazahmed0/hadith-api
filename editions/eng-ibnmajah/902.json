Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasuluhu. As’alu Allahal-jannah, wa a’udhu billahi minannar (In the name of Allah and by the grace of Allah. All compliments are due to Allah and all prayers and good words are due to Allah. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings; peace be upon us and upon the righteous slaves of Allah. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. I ask Allah for Paradise and I seek refuge with Allah from the Fire).’”",
