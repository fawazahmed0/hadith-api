In the morning, the jews came out with their spades and baskets. When they saw him, they said, \"Muhammad! By Allah, Muhammad and his army!\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said \"Allah is greater! Khaybar is destroyed. When we come to a people, it is an evil morning for those who have been warned",
