This is good!' Whoever is among the people of prayer, is called from the gate of prayer. Whoever is among the people of jihad is called from the gate of jihad. Whoever is among the people of sadaqa, is called from the gate of sadaqa. Whoever is among the people of fasting, is called from the gate of the well- watered. (Bab ar-Rayyan).\" Abu Bakr as-Siddiq said, \"Messenger of Allah! Is it absolutely necessary that one be called from one of these gates? Can someone be called from all of these gates?\" He said, \"Yes, and I hope you are among them .\" 21.20 Acquisition of the Land of Those who Surrender from the People of Dhimma",
