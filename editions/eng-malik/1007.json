			"text": "Malik was asked whether, when an imam had accepted jizya from a people and they gave it, he thought that the land of one of them who surrendered belonged to him or whether his land and property belonged to the Muslims. Malik said, \"That varies. As for the people of peace, if one of them surrenders, then he is entitled to his land and property. As for the people of force who use force, if one of them surrenders, his land and property belong to the Muslims because the people of force are overcome in their towns, and it becomes booty for the Muslims. As for the people of peace, their property and selves are protected so that they make peace for them. Only what they have made peace for is obliged of them.\" Yahya related to me from Malik from Abd ar-Rahman ibn Abi Sasaca that he had heard that Amr ibn al-Jamuh al-Ansari and Abdullah ibn Umar al-Ansari, both of the tribe of Banu Salami, had their grave uncovered by a flood. Their grave was part of what was left after the flood. They were in the same grave, and they were among those martyred at Uhud. They were dug up so that they might be moved. They were found unchanged. It was as if they had died only the day before. One of them had been wounded, and he had put his hand over his wound and had been buried like that. His hand was pulled away from his wound and released, and it returned to where it had been. It was forty-six years between Uhud and the day they were dug up. Malik said, \"There is no harm in burying two or three men in the same grave due to necessity. The oldest one is put next to the qibla",
