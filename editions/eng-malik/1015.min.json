{"metadata":{"name":"Muwatta Malik","section":{"22":"Vows and Oaths"}},"hadiths":[{"hadithnumber":1015,"arabicnumber":1015,"text":"Yahya related to me from Malik that what he preferred of what he had heard from the people of knowledge about a man or woman who vowed to walk to the House of Allah, was that they fulfilled the oath when performing umra, by walking until they had done say between Safa and Marwa. When they had done say it was finished. If they vowed to walk in the hajj, they walked until they came to Makka, then they walked until they had finished all the rites. Malik said, \"Walking is only for hajj or umra.\" Yahya related to me from Malik that Humayd ibn Qays and Thawr ibn Zayd adDili both informed him that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, (and one of them gave more detail than the other),saw a man standing in the sun. The Messenger asked, \"What's wrong with him?\" The people said, \"He has vowed not to speak or to seek shade from the sun or to sit and to fast.\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Go and tell him to speak, seek shade, and sit, but let him complete his fast.\" Malik said, \"I have not heard that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ordered the man in question to do any kaffara. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, only ordered him to complete that in which there was obedience to Allah and to abandon that in which there was disobedience to Allah","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih Lighairihi"}],"reference":{"book":22,"hadith":1015}}]}
