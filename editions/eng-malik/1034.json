The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"What about that?\" They said, \"You have forbidden the meat of sacrificial animals after three days.\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"I only forbade you for the sake of the people who were coming to you. Eat, give sadaqa and store up.\" By these people, he meant the poor people who were coming to Madina",
