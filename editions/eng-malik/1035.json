He asked whether it was meat from the sacrifice. They replied that it was. Abu Said said, \"Didn't the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbid that?\" They said, \"There has been a new command from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, since you went away.\" Abu Said went out and made enquiries about it and was told that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had said,\"I forbade you before to eat meat of the sacrifice after three days, but now eat, give sadaqa and store up. I forbade you before to make nabidh (by soaking raisins or dates in water), but now make nabidh, but remember every intoxicant is haram .I forbade you to visit graves, but now visit them, and do not use bad language",
