He said, \"There is no harm in eating it.\" Marwan said, \"Go to Zayd ibn Thabit and Abu Hurayra and ask them about it, then come to me and tell me what they say.\" They went to them and asked them, and they both said, \"There is no harm in eating it \" They returned to Marwan and told him. Marwan said, \"I told you.\" Malik said that there was no harm in eating fish caught by magians, because the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"In the sea's water is purity, and that which is dead in it is halal. \" Malik said, \"If it is eaten when it is dead, there is no harm in who catches it","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":25,"hadith":1061}}]}
