It does not mean that when a man has asked for a woman in marriage, and his suit does not agree with her and she does not incline to him that no one else can ask for her in marriage. That is a door to misery for people","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":28,"hadith":1092}}]}
