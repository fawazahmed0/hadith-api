I have given myself to you.\" She stood for a long time, and then a man got up and said, \"Messenger of Allah, marry her to me if you have no need of her.\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Do you have anything to give her as a bride-price?\" He said, \"I possess only this lower garment of mine.\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"If you give it to her you will not have a garment to wear so look for something else.\" He said, \"I have nothing else.\" He said, \"Look for something else, even if it is only an iron ring.\" He looked, and found that he had nothing. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Do you know any of the Qur'an?\" He said, \"Yes. I know such-and-such a sura and such-and-such a sura,\" which he named. The Messengerof Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him, \"I have married her to you for what you know of the Qur'an",
