He divorced her, and she got married in her idda-period. Umar ibn al-Khattab beat her and her husband with a stick several times, and separated them. Then Umar ibn al-Khattab said, \"If a woman marries in her idda-period, and the new husband has not consummated the marriage, then separate them, and when she has completed the idda of her first husband, the other becomes a suitor. If he has consummated the marriage then separate them. Then she must complete her idda from her first husband, and then the idda from the other one, and they are never to be reunited.\" Malik added, ''Said ibn al-Musayyab said that she had her dowry because he had consummated the marriage.\" Malik said,\"The practice with us concerning a free woman whose husband dies, is that she does an idda of four months and ten days and she does not marry if she doubts her period until she is free of any doubt or if she fears that she is pregnant","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":28,"hadith":1118}}]}
