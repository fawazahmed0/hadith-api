			"text": "Yahya related to me from Malik that he heard Ibn Shihab say that if a man said to his wife, \"You are free of me, and I am free of you, \" it counted as three pronouncements of divorce as if it were an 'irrevocable' divorce.

If he said he intended only one divorce he swore to it and he became one of the suitors because, whereas a woman whose marriage had been consummated was made inaccessible by three pronouncements of divorce, the woman whose marriage had not been consummated was made inaccessible by only one pronouncement. Malik said, \"That is the best of what I have heard",
