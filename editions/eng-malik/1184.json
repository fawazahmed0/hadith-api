The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out for the dawn prayer, and found Habiba bint Sahl at his door in the darkness. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to her, \"Who is this?\" She said, \"I am Habiba bint Sahl, Messenger of Allah.\" He said, \"What do you want?\" She said, \"That Thabit ibn Qays and I separate.\" When her husband, Thabit ibn Qays came, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him, \"This is Habiba bint Sahl. She mentioned what Allah willed that she mention.\" Habiba said, \"Messenger of Allah, all that he has given me is with me!\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to Thabit ibn Qays, \"Take it from her,\" and he took it from her, and she stayed in the house of her family",
