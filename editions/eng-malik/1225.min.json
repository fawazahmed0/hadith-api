His agent sent her some barley and she was displeased with it, saying, \"By Allah, I don't expect anything from you.\" She went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and mentioned it to him. He said, \"You have no maintenance.\" He then ordered her to spend her idda in the house of Umm Sharik. Then he said, \"This is a woman whom my companions visit. Spend the idda in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum. He is a blind man and you can undress at his home. When you are free to remarry, tell me.\" She continued, \"When I was free to remarry, I mentioned to him that Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan and Abu Jahm ibn Hisham had asked for me in marriage. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'As for Abu Jahm, he never puts down his stick from his shoulder (i.e. he is always travelling), and as for Muawiya he is a poor man with no property. Marry Usama ibn Zayd.' I objected to him and he said, 'Marry Usama ibn Zayd,' so I married him, and Allah put good in it and I was content with him","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":29,"hadith":1225}}]}
