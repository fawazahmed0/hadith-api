She did not apply kohl until her eyes almost had ramas (a dry white secretion in the corners of the eye). Malik said, \"A woman whose husband has died should anoint her eyes with olive oil and sesame oil and the like of that since there is no perfume in it.\" Malik said, \"A woman in mourning for her husband should not put on any jewellery - rings, anklets, or such- like, neither should she dress in any sort of colourful, striped garment unless it is coarse. She should not wear any cloth dyed with anything except black, and she should only dress her hair with things like lotus-tree leaves which do not dye the hair","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":29,"hadith":1269}}]}
