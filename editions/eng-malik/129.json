			"text": "Yahya related to me from Malik from Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr from his paternal aunt from the daughter of Zayd ibn Thabit that she had heard that women used to ask for lamps in the middle of the night to check their purity. She would criticise them for this saying, \"Women never used to do this,\" i.e. in the time of the companions. Malik was asked whether a woman whose period had finished could do tayammum to purify herself if she could not find waterand he said, \"Yes, because she is like some one in a state of major ritual impurity, who, if he cannot find water, does tayammum",
