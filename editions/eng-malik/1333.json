			"text": "Yahya related to me from Malik that he had heard that receipts were given to people in the time of Marwan ibn al-Hakam for the produce of the market at al-Jar. People bought and sold the receipts among themselves before they took delivery of the goods. Zayd Thabit and one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went to Marwan ibn al-Hakam and said, \"Marwan! Do you make usury halal?\" He said, \"I seek refuge with Allah! What is that?\" He said, \"These receipts which people buy and sell before they take delivery of the goods.\" Marwan therefore sent a guard to follow them and to take them from people's hands and return them to their owners",
