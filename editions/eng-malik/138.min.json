Similarly, if a woman who has given birth sees blood after she has reached the fullest extent that bleeding normally restrains women, her husband can have sexual intercourse with her and she is in the same position as a woman who bleeds as if menstruating.\" Yahya said that Malik said, \"The position with us concerning a woman who bleeds as if menstruating is founded on the hadith of Hisham ibn Urwa from his father, and it is what I prefer the most of what I have heard about the matter","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":2,"hadith":138}}]}
