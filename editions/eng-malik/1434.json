			"text": "Malik related to me from Amr ibn Yahya al-Mazini from his father that ad-Dahhak ibn Khalifa watered his irrigation ditch from a large source of water. He wanted to have it pass through the land of Muhammad ibn Maslama, and Muhammad refused. Ad-Dahhak said to him, \"Why do you prevent me? It will benefit you. You can drink from it first and last and it will not harm you.\" Muhammed refused so ad- Dahhak spoke about it to Umar ibn al-Khattab, and Umar ibn al-Khattab summoned Muhammad ibn Maslama and ordered him to clear the way. Muhammad said, \"No.\" Umar said, \"Why do you prevent your brother from what will benefit him and is also useful for you? You will take water from it first and last and it will not harm you.\" Muhammad said, \"No, by Allah!\" Umar said, \"By Allah, he will pass it through, even if it is over your belly!\" Umar ordered him to allow its passage and ad-Dahhak did so",
