That is against the slave's person and does not exceed the price of the slave whether it is little or much. If his master wishes to give the value of what the slave took or ruined, or pay the blood-price for the injury, he pays it and keeps his slave. If he wishes to surrender him, he surrenders him, and none of that is against him. The master has the option in that.\" Malik related to me from Ibn Shihab from Said ibn al-Musayyab that Uthman ibn Affan said, \"If someone gives something to his small child who is not old enough to look after it himself, and in order that his gift might be permitted he makes the gift public and has it witnessed, the gift is permitted, even if the father keeps charge of it.\" Malik said, \"What is done in our community is that if a man gives his small child some gold or silver and then dies and he has it in his own keeping, the child has none of it unless the father set it aside in coin or placed it with a man to keep for the son. If he does that, it is permitted for the son","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":1463}}]}
