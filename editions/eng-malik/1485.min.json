One of the two with the same mother died and left property and mawali. His full brother inherited his property and the wala' of his mawali. Then he also died, and left as heirs his son and his paternal half brother. His son said, \"I obtain what my father inherited of property and the wala' of the mawali.\" His brother said, \"It is not like that. You obtain the property. As for the wala' of the mawali, it is not so. Do you think that had it been my first brother who died today, I would not have inherited from him?\" They argued and went to Uthman ibn Affan. He gave a judgement that the brother had the wala' of the mawali","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Daif"}],"reference":{"book":38,"hadith":1485}}]}
