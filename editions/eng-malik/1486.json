			"text": "Malik related to me from Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr ibn Hazm that his father told him that he was sitting with Aban ibn Uthman, and an argument was brought to him between some people from the Juhayna tribe and some people from the Banu al-Harith ibn al-Khazraj. A woman of the Juhayna tribe was married to a man from the Banu al-Harith ibn al- Khazraj, called Ibrahim ibn Kulayb. She died and left property and mawali, and her son and husband inherited them from her. Then her son died and his heirs said, \"We have the wala' of the mawali. Her son obtained them.\" Those of the Juhayna said, \"It is not like that. They are the mawali of our female associate. When her child died, we have their wala' and we inherit them.\" Aban ibn Uthman gave a judgement that the people from the Juhayna tribe did indeed have the wala' of the mawali",
