			"text": "Malik related to me from Hisham ibn Urwa that his father said that there was only one hadd against a man who slandered a group of people. Malik said, \"If they are on separate occasions there is still only one hadd against him.\" Malik related to me from Abu'r-Rijal Muhammad ibn Abd ar-Rahman ibn Haritha ibn an-Numan al- Ansari, then from the Banu'n-Najar from his mother Amra bint Abd ar- Rahman that two men cursed each other in the time of Umar ibn al- Khattab. One of them said to the other, \" By Allah, my father is not an adulterer and my mother is not an adulteress.\" Umar ibn al-Khattab asked advice about that. One person said, \"He has praised his father and mother.\" Another said, \"His father and mother have praise other than this. We think that he is to be flogged with the hadd.\" So Umar flogged him with the hadd of eighty lashes. Malik said, \"There is no hadd in our view except for slander, denial or insinuation, in which one sees that the speaker intends by that denial or slander. Then the hadd is completely imposed on the one who said it.\" Malik said, \"What is done in our community when a man denies that another man is from his father, is that he deserves the hadd. If the mother who is denied is a slave, then he deserves the hadd as well",
