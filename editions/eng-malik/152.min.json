They are at the timeof the adhan, and in a rank of people fighting in the way of Allah.\" Malik was asked whether the adhan on the day of jumua was called before the time had come for the prayer and he said, \"It is not called until after the sun has passed the meridian.\" Malik was asked about doubling the adhan and the iqama, and at what point people had to stand when the iqama for the prayer was called. He said, \"I have heard nothing about the adhan and iqama except what I have seen people do. As for the iqama, it is not doubled. That is what the people of knowledge in our region continue to do. As for people standing up when the iqama for the prayer is called, I have not heard of any definite point at which it is begun, and I consider it rather to be according to people's (individual) capacity, for some people are heavy and some are light, and they are not able to be as one man .\" Malik was asked about a gathering of people who wished to do the prescribed prayer calling the iqama and not the adhan, and he said, \"lt is enough for them. The adhan is only obligatory in mosques where the prayer is said in congregation.\" Malik was asked about the muadhdhin saying \"Peace be upon you\" to the imam and calling him to the prayer, and he was asked who was the first person to whom such a greeting was made. He replied, \"I have not heard that this greeting occurred in the first community.\" Yahya said that Malik was asked whether a muadhdhin who called the people to prayer and then waited to see if anyone would come and no one did, so he said the iqama and did the prayer by himself and then people came after he had finished, should repeat the prayer with them. Malik said, \"He does not repeat the prayer, and whoever comes after he has finished should do the prayer by himself.\" Yahya said that Malik was asked about a muadhdhin who called the adhan for a group of people, did voluntary prayers, and then the group of people wanted to do the prayer with some one else saying the iqama. He said, \"There is no harm in that. His iqama or somebody else's are the same.\" Yahya said that Malik said, \"The subh prayer is still called before dawn. As for the other prayers, we believe that they should only be called after the time has started","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":3,"hadith":152}}]}
