When the slave-girl becomes pregnant, her value is estimated and he gives his partners their shares of the price and the slave-girl is his. That is what is done among us.\" Malik said about a man who made his slave-girl halal to a man that if the one for whom she was made halal had intercourse with her, her value was estimated on the day he had intercourse with her and he owed that to her owner whether or not she conceived. The hadd was averted from him by that. If she conceived the child was connected to him. Malik said about a man who had intercourse with his son's or daughter's slave-girl, \"The hadd is averted from him and he owes the estimated value of the slave-girl whether or not she conceives.\" Malik related to me from Rabia ibn Abi Abd ar-Rahman that Umar ibn al-Khattab spoke about a man who went out with his wife's slave- girl on a journey and had intercourse with her and then the wife became jealous and mentioned that to Umar ibn al-Khattab. Umar questioned him about it. He said, \"She gave her to me.\" Umar said, \"Bring me a clear proof or I will stone you.\" Rabia added, \"The wife confessed that she had given her to him","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Daif"}],"reference":{"book":41,"hadith":1520}}]}
