Abu Bakr said, \"By your father, your night is not the night of a thief.\" Then they missed a necklace of Asma bint Umays, the wife of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq. The man came to go around with them looking for it. He said, \"O Allah! You are responsible for the one who invaded the people of this good house by night!\" They found the jewelry with a goldsmith. He claimed that the maimed man had brought it to him. The maimed man confessed or it was testified against him. Abu Bakr as-Siddiq ordered that his left hand be cut off. Abu Bakr said, \"By Allah! His dua against himself is more serious, as far as I am concerned, than his theft.\" Yahya said that Malik said, \"What is done among us about the person who steals several times and is then called to reckoning, is that only his hand is cut off for all he stole when the hadd has not been applied againsthim. If the hadd has been applied against him before that, and he steals what obliges cutting off, then the next limb is cut off","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Daif"}],"reference":{"book":41,"hadith":1531}}]}
