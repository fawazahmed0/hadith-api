They said, \"Only this drink helps.\" Umar said, \"Drink this honey preparation.\" They said, \"Honey does not help us.\" A man from the people of that land said, \"Can we give you something of this drink which does not intoxicate?\" He said, \"Yes.\" They cooked it until two- thirds of it evaporated and one-third of it remained. Then they brought it to Umar. Umar put his finger in it and then lifted his head and extended it. He said, \"This is fruit juice concentrated by boiling. This is like the distillation with which you smear the camel's scabs.\" Umar ordered them to drink it. Ubada ibn as-Samit said to him, \"You have made it halal, by Allah!\" Umar said, \"No, by Allah! O Allah! I will not make anything halal for them which You have made haram for them! I will not make anything haram for them which You have made halal for them","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":42,"hadith":1550}}]}
