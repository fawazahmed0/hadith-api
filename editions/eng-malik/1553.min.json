The people of silver are the people of Iraq \" Yahya related to me from Malik that he heard that the blood-money was divided into instalments over three or four years. Malik said, \"Three is the most preferable to me of what I have heard on that.\" Malik said, \"The generally agreed on way of doing things in our community is that camels are not accepted from the people of cities for blood-money nor is gold or silver accepted from the desert people.
