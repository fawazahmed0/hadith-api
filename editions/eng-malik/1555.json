Muawiya wrote to him, \"Tie him up and do not inflict any retaliation on him. There is no retaliation against a madman.\" Malik said about an adult and a child when they murder a man together, \"The adult is killed and the child pays half the full blood-money.\" Malik said, \"It is like that with a freeman and a slave when they murder a slave. The slave is killed and the freeman pays half of his value",
