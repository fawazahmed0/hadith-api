The one against whom the judgement was given said, \"Why should I pay damages for that which did not drink or eat or speak or make any cry. The like of that is nothing.\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"This is only one of the brothers of the diviners.\" He disapproved of the rhyming speech of the man's declaration",
