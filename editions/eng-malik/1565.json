Ibn Shihab said, \"If the healthy person wants to take retaliation from him, he can have his retaliation. If he prefers, he has blood-money of one thousand dinars, twelve thousand dirhams.\" Yahya related to me from Malik that he heard that full blood- money was payable for both of a pair of anything in a man that occurred in pairs, and the tongue had full blood-money. The ears, when their hearing departed, had full blood-money, whether or not they were cut off, and a man's penis had full blood-money and the testicles had full blood-money. Yahya related to me from Malik that he heard that the breasts of a woman had full blood-money. Malik said, \"The least of that are the eyebrows and a man's breasts.\" Malik said, \"What is done in our community when a man is injured in his extremities to an extent that obliges payment of more than the amount of his full blood-money, is that it is his right. If his hands, feet, and eyes are all injured, he has three full blood-moneys.\" Malik said about the sound eye of a one-eyed man when it is accidentally gouged out, \"The full blood-money is payable for it",
