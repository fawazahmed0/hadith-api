Uhayha took him and killed him. His maternal uncles said, \"We brought him up from a baby to a youth till he stood firm on his feet, and we have had the right of a man taken from us by his paternal uncle.\" Urwa said, \"For that reason a killer does not inherit from the one he killed.\" Malik said, \"The way of doing things about which there is no dispute is that the intentional murderer does not inherit anything of the blood-money of the person he has murdered or any of his property. He does not stop anyone who has a share of inheritance from inheriting. The one who kills accidentally does not inherit anything of the blood-money and there is dispute as to whether or not he inherits from the dead person's property because there is no suspicion that he killed him for his inheritance and in order to take his property. I prefer that he inherit from the dead person's property and not inherit from the blood-money","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":43,"hadith":1588}}]}
