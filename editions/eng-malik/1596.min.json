Muhayyisa returned and said that Abdullah ibn Sahl had been killed and thrown in a shallow well or spring. The jews came and he said, \"By Allah! You have killed him.\" They said, \"By Allah! We have not killed him!\" Then he made for his people and mentioned that to them. Then he, his brother Huwayyisa, who was older than him, and Abd ar-Rahman, set out. Muhayyisa began to speak, as he had been at Khaybar. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him, \"The greater first, the greater first,\" meaning in age. So Huwayyisa spoke and then Muhayyisa spoke. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Either they pay your companion's blood-money or we will declare war against them.\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wrote that to them and they wrote, \"By Allah, we did not kill him!\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to Huwayyisa, Muhayyisa, and Abd ar-Rahman, \"Do you swear and claim the blood of your companion?\" They said, \"No.\" He said, \"Shall the jews swear to you?\" They said, \"But they are not muslims.\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave blood-money from his own property, and sent them one hundred camels to their house. Sahl added, \"A red camel among them kicked me","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":44,"hadith":1596}}]}
