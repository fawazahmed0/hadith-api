When the jews of Khaybar left, they did not take any fruit or land. The jews of Fadak took half the fruit and half the land, because the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had made a settlement with them for that. So Umar entrusted to them the value in gold, silver, camels, ropes and saddle bags of half the fruit and half the land, and handed the value over to them and expelled them","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih Lighairihi"}],"reference":{"book":45,"hadith":1615}}]}
