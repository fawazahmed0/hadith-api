He saw that he had some nabidh with him and he was at that moment on the way to Makka. Aslam said to him, ''Umar ibn al-Khattab loves this drink.\" Abdullah ibn Ayyash therefore carried a great drinking bowl and brought it to Umar ibn al-Khattab and placed it before him. Umar brought it near to him and then raised his head. Umar said, \"This drink is good,\" so he drank some of it and then passed it to a man on his right. When Abdullah turned to go, Umar ibn al-Khattab called him and asked, \"Are you the person who says that Makka is better than Madina?\" Abdullah said, \"I said that it was the Haram of Allah, and His place of security, and His House was in it.\" Umar said, \"I am not saying anything about the House of Allah or His Haram.\" Then Umar repeated \"Are you the person who says that Makka is better than Madina?\" He replied, \"I said that it was the Haram of Allah and His place of security, and His House was in it.\" Umar said, \"I am not saying anything about the House of Allah and His Haram.\" Then Abdullah left",
