When he came to Sargh, near Tabuk, he heard that the plague had broken out in ash-Sham. Abd ar-Rahman ibn Awf told him that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"If you hear that a land has a plague in it, do not go forward to it. If it comes upon a land which you are in, do not depart in flight from it.\" Umar ibn al- Khattab came back from Sargh",
