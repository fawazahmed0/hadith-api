Then he remembered that he had not said the takbir at the opening nor in the ruku,so he said the takbir in the second raka. He said, \"I prefer that he start his prayer again, but if he forgets the opening takbir with the imam and says the takbir in the first ruku, I consider that enough for him if he intends by it the opening takbir.\" Malik said, about some one who prayed by himself and forgot the opening takbir, \"He begins his prayer afresh .\" Malik said, about an imam who forgot the opening takbir until he had finished his prayer, \"I think that he should do the prayer again, and those behind him, even if they have said the takbir","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":3,"hadith":169}}]}
