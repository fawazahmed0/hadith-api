He questioned them and they said, \"Hunger has driven us out.\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"And hunger has brought me out.\" They went to Abu'l-Haytham ibn at- Tayyihan al-Ansari. He ordered that some barley that was in the house be prepared and he got up to slaughter a sheep for them. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Leave the one with milk.\" He slaughtered a sheep for them and brought them sweet water and it was hung on a palm-tree. Then they were brought the food and ate it and drank the water. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, recited, \"Then, on that day, you will be asked concerning pleasure.\" (Sura 102 ayat 8)",
