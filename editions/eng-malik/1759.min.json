Two came toward the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and one went away. When the two stopped at the assembly of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, they gave the greeting. One of them saw a gap in the circle and sat in it. The other sat down behind the circle. The third turned away and left. When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, finished, he said, \"Shall I tell you about three people? One of them sought shelter with Allah, so Allah gave him shelter. The other was shy, so Allah was shy to him. The other turned away, so Allah turned away from him","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":53,"hadith":1759}}]}
