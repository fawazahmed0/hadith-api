What have I done wrong?\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"What is the meaning of this cushion?\" She said, \"I bought it for you to sit and recline on.\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Those who make such pictures will be punished on the Day of Rising.
