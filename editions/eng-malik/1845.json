She said to her female mawla, \"Give it to him.\" The mawla protested, \"You will not have anything to break your fast with.\" A'isha repeated, \"Give it to him,\" so she did so. When evening came, the people of a house or a man who did not usually give to them, gave them a sheep and some food to go with it. A'isha, umm al-muminin, called her mawla and said, \"Eat from this. This is better than your loaf of bread",
