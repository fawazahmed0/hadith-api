When he came to ask him for some camels from the sadaqa, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was so angry that the anger showed in his face. One way in which anger could be recognised in his face was that his eyes became red. Then he said, \"This man has asked me for what is not good for me or him. If I refuse it, I hate to refuse. If I give it to him, I will give him what is not good for me or him.\" The man said, \"Messenger of Allah! I will never ask you for any of it","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":58,"hadith":1854}}]}
