That is because the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said in the hadith related by Ibn Umar, 'When you come to jumua, do ghusl .' \" Malik said, \"If someone does ghusl on the day of jumua and intends by it the ghusl of the day of jumua and then sets out, whether early or late, and does something which breaks his wudu, he only has to do wudu and his ghusl remains valid for him",
