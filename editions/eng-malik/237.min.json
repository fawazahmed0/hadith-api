Malik said that someone who prayed a raka with the imam on the day of jumua, then had a nosebleed and left and came back and the imam had prayed both rakas, should complete the prayer with another raka as long as he had not spoken. Malik said, \"If some one has a nosebleed, or something happens to him and he has no alternative but to leave, he does not have to ask permission of the imam if he wants to leave on the day of jumua.\" Yahya related to me from Malik that he had asked Ibn Shihab about the word of Allah, the Majestic, the Mighty, \"O you who accept, when the call is made for the prayer on the day of jumua, make haste to the remembrance of Allah.\"(Sura 62 ayat 9). Ibn Shihab said, ''Umar ibn al-Khattab used to recite, 'When the call is made for the prayer on the day of jumua, go to the remembrance of Allah.' \" Malik said, \"Making haste in the Book of Allah is only deed and action. Allah the Blessed, the Exalted, says 'and when he turns away, he acts in the land' (Sura 2 ayat 205), and He, the Exalted, said, 'and as for the one who comes to you acting with fear' (Sura 80 ayat 8), and He said, 'then he turned his back, and acted' (Sura 79 ayat 22),and He said, 'Your deeds are diverse' \" (Sura 92 ayat 4). Malik said, \"Thus making haste which Allah mentions in His Book is not running on the feet or exertion. It only means deed and actions","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":237}}]}
