Just then a cat came to drink from it, so he tilted the vessel towards it to let it drink. Kabsha continued, \"He saw me looking at him and said, 'Are you surprised, daughter of my brother?' I said, 'Yes.' He replied that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, cats are not impure.
