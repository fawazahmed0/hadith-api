He then prayed one raka with the group he was with, and then remained standing while they finished by themselves. They then left and formed a row opposite the enemy, and then the other group came and he prayed the remaining raka of his prayer with them, and then remained sitting while they finished by themselves. Then he said the taslim with them","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":11,"hadith":441}}]}
