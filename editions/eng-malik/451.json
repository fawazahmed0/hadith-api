The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, made dua, and it rained on us from one jumua to the next.\" Anas continued, \"Then a man came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah, our houses have fallen down, the paths are blocked, and our flocks are dying.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'O Allah, (only) the mountain and hill-tops, the valley bottoms, and the places where trees grow.' \" Anas added, \"It cleared away from Madina like a garment being removed.\" Malik said, about a man who missed the prayer of asking for rain but caught the khutba, and wished to pray in the mosque, or in his house when he returned, \"He is free to do so, or not, as he wishes",
