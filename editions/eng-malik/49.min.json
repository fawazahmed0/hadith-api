When they reached as Suhba, which was near Khaybar, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stopped and prayed asr. He asked for provisions but only parched barley was brought, so he asked for it to be moistened. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ate and the people ate with him. Then he got up to do maghrib and rinsed his mouth out and they rinsed out theirs. Then he prayed without doing wudu","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":2,"hadith":49}}]}
