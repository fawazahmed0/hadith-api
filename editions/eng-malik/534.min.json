The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Let me know if she dies.\" Her bier was brought out at night- time and they did not want to wake up the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. In the morning the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was told what had happened to her and he said, \"Didn't I tell you to let me know if she died?\" They replied, \"Messenger of Allah, we did not want to wake you up and make you come out in the night.\" Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out and formed everyone into rows by her grave and said \"Allah is greater\" four times","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":16,"hadith":534}}]}
