He called to him but he did not reply. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"We belong to Allah, and to Him we are returning,\" and added, \"You are being taken from us, Abur-Rabi`.\" The women cried out and wept, and Jabir began to silence them. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Leave them, and when the necessary time comes, none of the women should cry.\" They said, \"Messenger of Allah, what is the necessary time?\" and he replied, \"When he dies.\" The dying man's daughter said, \"By Allah, I hope that you will be a martyr, for you have completed your preparations for battle,\" and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Allah has made his reward fall according to his intention. What do you consider dying a martyr to be?\" They said, \"Death in the way of Allah.\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"There are seven kinds of martyr other than those killed in the way of Allah. Someone who is killed by the plague is a martyr, someone who drowns is a martyr, someone who dies of pleurisy is a martyr, someone who dies of a disease of the belly is a martyr, someone who dies by fire is a martyr, someone who dies under a falling building is a martyr and a woman who dies in childbirth is a martyr","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih Lighairihi"}],"reference":{"book":16,"hadith":555}}]}
