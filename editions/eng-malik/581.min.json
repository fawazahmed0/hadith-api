Al- Qasim said, \"Abu Bakr as-Siddiq did not take zakat from anyone's property until it had been in his possession for a year.\" Al- Qasim ibn Muhammad continued, \"When Abu Bakr gave men their allowances he would ask them, 'Do you have any property on which zakat is due?' If they said, 'Yes,' he would take the zakat on that property out of their allowances. If they said, 'No,' he would hand over their allowances to them without deducting anything from them","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Daif"}],"reference":{"book":17,"hadith":581}}]}
