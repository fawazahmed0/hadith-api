If capital is required or great labour is incurred, or on one occasion the mark is hit and on another it is missed, then it is not rikaz.\" Yahya related to me from Malik from Abd ar-Rahman ibn al-Qasim from his father that A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to look after the orphaned daughters of her brother in her house. They had jewellery (which they wore) and she did not take zakat from this jewellery of theirs","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":17,"hadith":587}}]}
