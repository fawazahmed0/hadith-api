Malik said, \"Anyone who has unminted gold or silver, or gold and silver jewellery which is not used for wearing, must pay zakat on it every year. It is weighed and one-fortieth is taken, unless it falls short of twenty dinars of gold or two hundred dirhams of silver, in which case there is no zakat to pay. Zakat is paid only when jewellery is kept for purposes other than wearing. Bits of gold and silver or broken jewellery which the owner intends to mend to wear are in the same position as goods which are worn by their owner - no zakat has to be paid on them by the owner.\" Malik said, \"There is no zakat (to pay) on pearls, musk or amber","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":17,"hadith":588}}]}
