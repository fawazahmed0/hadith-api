In my opinion it is the same as if he had a debt, which is why I think it should be given priority over bequests.\" Malik continued, \"This applies if the deceased has asked for the zakat to be deducted. If the deceased has not asked for it to be deducted but his family do so then that is good, but it is not binding upon them if they do not do it.\" Malik continued, \"The sunna which we are all agreed upon is that zakat is not due from someone who inherits a debt (i.e. wealth that was owed to the deceased), or goods, or a house, or a male or female slave, until a year has elapsed over the price realised from whatever he sells (i.e. slaves or a house, which are not zakatable) or over the wealth he inherits, from the day he sold the things, or took possession of them.\" Malik said, \"The sunna with us is that zakat does not have to be paid on wealth that is inherited until a year has elapsed over it.\" Yahya related to me from Malik from Ibn Shihab from as-Sa'ib ibn Yazid that Uthman ibn Affan used to say, \"This is the month for you to pay your zakat. If you have any debts then pay them off so that you can sort out your wealth and take the zakat from it",
