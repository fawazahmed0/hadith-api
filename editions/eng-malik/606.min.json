The man told him that he had come to a watering-place, which he named, and had found grazing livestock from the zakat watering there. He was given some of their milk, which he then put into his water-skin, and that was the milk in question. Umar ibn al-Khattab then put his hand into his mouth to make himself vomit.\" Malik said, \"The position with us is that if anyone refuses to honour one of the obligatory demands of Allah, and the muslims are unable to get it, then they have the right to fight him until they get itfrom him","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Daif"}],"reference":{"book":17,"hadith":606}}]}
