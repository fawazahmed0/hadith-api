He had nine platters, and on each of the platters he put some of every fruit and delicacy that there was and then sent them to the wives of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the one he sent to his daughter Hafsa was the last of them all, and if there was any deficiency in any of them it was in Hafsa's portion. \"He put meat from the slaughtered animal on the platters and sent them to the wives of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he ordered what was left of the meat of the slaughtered animal to be prepared. Then he invited the Muhajirun and the Ansar to eat it.\" Malik said, \"I do not think that livestock should be taken from people who pay the jizya except as jizya","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":17,"hadith":618}}]}
