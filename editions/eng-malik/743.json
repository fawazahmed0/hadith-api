			"text": "Yahya related to me from Malik that he had heard the people of knowledge say, \"If someone goes into ihram to do hajj on its own, he cannot then go into ihram to do umra.'' Malik said, \"This is what I have found the people of knowledge in our city doing.\" Yahya related to me from Malik, from Jafar ibn Muhammad, from his father, that al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad once went to see AIi ibn Abi Talibat as-Suqya, where he was feeding some young camels of his with a mash of meal and leaves, and he said to him, \"This man Uthman ibn Affan is telling people that they cannot do hajj and umra together.\" Al-Miqdad said, \"Ali ibn Abi Talib went off with bits of meal and leaves on his forearms - and I shall never forget the sight of the meal and the leaves on his arms - and went to see Uthman ibn Affan and asked him, 'Are you saying then that people cannot do hajj and umra together?' Uthman replied, 'That is my opinion.' Whereupon AIi got angry and went out saying, 'I am at your service, O Allah, I am at your service for a hajj and an umra together.' \" Malik said, \"Our position (here in Madina) is that someone who does hajj and umra together should not remove any of his hair, nor should he come out of ihram in any way until he has sacrificed an animal, if he has one. He should come out of ihram at Mina, on the day of the sacrifice",
