He would go into ihram for hajj at the beginning of Dhu'l-Hijja, and Urwa ibn az- Zubayr, who was with him, would do likewise. Yahya said that Malik said, \"The people of Makka and whoever else is living there besides them should go into ihram for hajj if they are in Makka, and anyone that is living in the centre of Makka and is not one of the people of Makka should not leave the Haram.\" Yahya said that Malik said, \"Someone who goes into ihram for hajj in Makka should delay tawaf of the House and the sa'y between Safa and Marwa until he has come back from Mina, which is what Abdullah ibn Umar used to do.\" Malik was asked what the people of Madina, or anybody else, should do about tawaf if they went into ihram in Makka at the beginning of Dhu'l-Hijja, and he said, \"They should delay the obligatory tawaf, which is the one they combine with the say between Safa and Marwa, but they can do whatever other tawaf they want to, and they should pray two rakas every time they complete seven tawafs, which is what the companions of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did when they had gone into ihram to do hajj. They delayed the tawaf of the House and the sa'y between Safa and Marwa until they had come back from Mina. Abdullah ibn Umar also did this, going into ihram for hajj in Makka at the beginning of Dhu'l-Hijja, and then delaying tawaf of theHouse and the say between Safa and Marwa until he had come back from Mina.\" Malik was asked whether one of the people of Makka could go into ihram to do umra in the centre of Makka, and he said, \"No. He should go outside the Haram and go into ihram there","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":20,"hadith":753}}]}
