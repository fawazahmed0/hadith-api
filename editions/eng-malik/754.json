I have sent one, so write and tell me what you say about this, or tell the man in charge of the animal what to do. Amra said that A'isha said, \"It is notas Ibn Abbas has said. I once plaited the garlands for the sacrificial animal of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with my own two hands. Then after that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, himself put the garlands on the animal and then sent it with my father. And there was nothing that Allah had made halal forthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, that was haram for him until such time as the animal had been sacrificed",
