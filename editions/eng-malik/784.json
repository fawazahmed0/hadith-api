			"text": "Yahya related to me from Malik, from Zayd ibn Aslam, from Ata ibn Yasar, that Kab al-Ahbar was once coming back from Syria with a group of riders, and at a certain point along the road they found some game- meat and Kab said they could eat it. When they got back to Madina they went to Umar ibn al-Khattab and told him about that, and he said, \"Who told you you could do that?\", and they said, ''Kab.'' He said, \"He was indeed the one I made amir over you until you should return.\" Later, when they were on the road to Makka, a swarm of locusts passed them by and Kab told them to catch them and eat them. When they got back to Umar ibn al-Khattab they told him about this, and he said (to Kab), \"What made you tell them they could do that?\" Kab said, \"It is game of the sea.\" He said, \"How do you know?\", and Kab said, \"Amir al- muminin, by the One in whose hand my self is, it is only the sneeze of a fish which it sneezes twice every year.\" Malik was asked whether a muhrim could buy game that he had found on the way. He replied, \"Game that is only hunted to be offered to people performing Hajj I disapprove of and forbid, but there is no harm in game that a man has which he does not intend for those in ihram, but which a muhrim finds and buys.\" Malik said, about someone who had some game with him that he had hunted or bought at the time when he had entered into ihram, that he did not have to get rid of it, and that there was no harm in him giving it to his family. Malik said that it was halal for some one in ihram to fish in the sea or in rivers and lakes, etc",
