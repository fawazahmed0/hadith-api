Then shave or cut your hair and return home. Then, in another year, do hajj and sacrifice an animal, and if you cannot find one, fast three days on hajj and seven when you return home.\" Malik said, \"Someone who intends to do hajj and umra together and then misses the hajj must do hajj again in another year, doing hajj with umra, and offer two sacrificial animals, one for doing the hajj with umra, and one for the hajj that he has missed","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Daif"}],"reference":{"book":20,"hadith":862}}]}
