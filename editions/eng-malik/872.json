			"text": "Yahya related to me from Malik that he had heard one of the people of knowledge say, \"A man and wife should not share in one sacrificial animal. Each should sacrifice an animal separately.\" Malik was asked about whether someone who had been entrusted with an animal for him to sacrifice on hajj, who went into ihram for umra, should sacrifice it when he came out of ihram or postpone it so that he sacrificed it at the time of the hajj while in the meantime he came out of ihram from his umra. He said, \"He should postpone it so that he may sacrifice it at the time of the hajj, and meanwhile come out of ihram from his umra.\" Malik said, \"If it is judged that some- one must offer an animal for having killed game, or for any other reason, this animal can only be sacrificed at Makka, since Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, says, 'a sacrificial animal which will reach the Kaba.' The fasting or sadaqa that is considered equivalent to offering a sacrifice can be done outside Makka, and the person who is doing it can do it wherever he likes.\" Yahya related to me from Malik from Yahya ibn Said from Yaqub ibn Khalid al-Makhzumi that Abu Asma, the mawla of Abdullah ibn Jafar, told him that he was with Abdullah ibn Jafar when they set out once from Madina. At as-Suqya they passed by Husayn ibn Ali, who was ill at the time. Abdullah ibn Jafar stayed with him and then, when he feared that he was late (for the hajj) he left, and sent for Ali ibn Abi Talib and Asma bint Umays in Madina, and they came to Husayn. Then Husayn pointed to his head, and AIi told someone to shave his head. Then he sacrificed an animal for him at as-Suqya, killing a camel for him. Yahya ibn Said added, \"Husayn had set out with Uthman ibn Affan on that particular journey to Makka",
