However, it is better for him to be in wudu for all those things, and he should not make a general practice of it.\" Malik was asked whether a man who was riding should get down to do the standing at Arafa or if he could stand while mounted, and he said, \"He can stand while mounted, unless he or his riding beast have an illness, in which case Allah is the one who most often accepts an excuse.\" Yahya related to me from Malik from Nafi that Abdullah ibn Umar used to say, \"Someone who does not stand at Arafa on the night of Muzdalifa before the dawn breaks has missed the hajj, and someone who stands at Arafa on the night of Muzdalifa before the dawn breaks has caught the hajj","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":20,"hadith":875}}]}
