Abd ar-Rahman added, \"Sometimes he would enter the mosque and do the witr prayer there without actually going near the House.\" Malik said, \"At-tafath is shaving the head, putting on normal clothes and things of that nature.\" Yahya said that Malik was asked whether a man who forgot to shave (his head) at Mina during the hajj could shave in Makka, and he said, \"That is permissible, but I prefer the shaving to be done at Mina.\" Malik said, \"What we are all agreed upon here (in Madina) is that no-one should shave his head or cut his hair until he has killed his sacrificial animal, if he has one, and things that are haram for him do not become halal for him until he leaves ihram at Mina on the day of sacrifice. This is because Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, says, 'Do not shave yourheads until the sacrificial animal has reached its destination","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":20,"hadith":890}}]}
