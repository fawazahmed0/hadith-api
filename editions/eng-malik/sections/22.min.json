A man said, 'Shall I give you this small cucumber?' and he had a small cucumber in his hand and you will say, 'I must walk to the house of Allah?' I said, 'Yes' and I said it, for at that time I was still immature. Then, when I came of age, some one said to me that I had to fulfill my vow. I went and asked Said ibn al- Musayyab about it, and he said to me, 'You must walk.'

When I came to Madina I questioned the ulama there, and they ordered me to walk again from the place from which I was unable to go on. So I walked.\" Yahya said that he had heard Malik say, \"What is done among us regarding someone who makes a vow to walk to the House of Allah, and then cannot do it and so rides, is that he must return and walk from the place from which he was unable to go on. If he cannot walk, he should walk what he can and then ride, and he must sacrifice a camel, a cow, or a sheep if that is all that he can find.\" Malik, when asked about a man who said to another, \"I will carry you to the House of Allah\", answered, \"If he intended to carry him on his shoulder, by that he meant hardship and exhaustion to himself, and he does not have to do that. Let him walk by foot and make sacrifice. If he did not intend anything, let him do hajj and ride, and take the man on hajj with him. That is because he said, 'I will carry you to the house of Allah.' If the man refuses to do hajj with him, then there is nothing against him, and what is demanded of him is cancelled.\" Yahya said that Malik was asked whether it was enough for a man who had made a vow that he would walk to the House of Allah a certain (large) number of times, or who had forbidden himself from talking to his father and brother, if he did not fulfil a certain vow, and he had taken upon himself, by the oath, something which he was incapable of fulfilling in his lifetime, even though he were to try every year, to fulfil only one or a (smaller) number of vows by Allah?

When they had done say it was finished. If they vowed to walk in the hajj, they walked until they came to Makka, then they walked until they had finished all the rites. Malik said, \"Walking is only for hajj or umra.\" Yahya related to me from Malik that Humayd ibn Qays and Thawr ibn Zayd adDili both informed him that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, (and one of them gave more detail than the other),saw a man standing in the sun. The Messenger asked, \"What's wrong with him?\" The people said, \"He has vowed not to speak or to seek shade from the sun or to sit and to fast.\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Go and tell him to speak, seek shade, and sit, but let him complete his fast.\" Malik said, \"I have not heard that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ordered the man in question to do any kaffara.

This is rashness.\" Malik said, \"The binding oath is for example, that a man says that he will not sell his garment for ten dinars, and then he sells it for that, or that he will beat his young slave and then does not beat him, and so on. One does kaffara for making such an oath, and there is no kaffara in rashness.\" Malik said, \"As for the one who swears to a thing which he knows is wicked, and he swears to a lie he knows to be a lie, in order to please someone with it or to excuse himself to someone by it or to gain money by it, no kaffara that he does for it can cover it","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":22,"hadith":1018}},{"hadithnumber":1019,"arabicnumber":1019,"text":"Yahya related to me from Malik from Nafi that Abdullah ibn Umar said, \"Whoever swears by Allah and then says, 'Allah willing' and then does not do what he has sworn to, has not broken his oath.\" Malik said, \"The best I have heard on this reservation is that it belongs to the statement made if the speaker does not break the normal flow of speech before he is silent.

Malik said, \"Emphasis is when a man swears one thing several times, repeating the oath in his speech time after time. For instance, the statement, 'By Allah, I will not decrease it from such-and-such,' sworn three times or more. The kaffara of that is like the kaffara of one oath. If a man swears, 'I will not eat this food or wear these clothes or enter this house,' that is all in one oath, and he is only obliged to do one kaffara. It is the same for a man who says to his wife, 'You are divorced if I clothe you in this garment or let you go to the mosque,' and it is one entire statement in the normal pattern of speech. If he breaks any of that oath, divorce is necessary, and there is no breaking of oath after that in whatever he does. There is only one oath to be broken in that.\" Malik said, \"What we do about a woman who makes a vow without her husband's permission is that she is allowed to do so and she must fulfill it, if it only concerns her own person and will not harm her husband.
