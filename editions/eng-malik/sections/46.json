'Am I not your Lord?' They said, 'Yes, we bear witness' Lest you should say on the Day of Rising, 'We were heedless of that.'\" (Sura 7 ayat 172) Umar ibn al-Khattab said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, being asked about it. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, created Adam. Then He stroked his back with His right hand, and progeny issued from it. He said, \"I created these for the Garden and they will act with the behaviour of the people of the Garden.\" Then He stroked his back again and brought forth progeny from him. He said, \"I created these for the Fire and they will act with the behaviour of the people of the Fire.\" 'A man said, 'Messenger of Allah! Then of what value are deeds?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, answered, 'When Allah creates a slave for the Garden, he makes him use the behaviour of the people of the Garden, so that he dies on one of the actions of the people of the Garden and by it He brings him into the Garden. When He creates a slave for the Fire, He makes him use the behaviour of the people of the Fire, so that he dies on one of the actions of the people of the Fire, and by it, He brings him into the Fire",
