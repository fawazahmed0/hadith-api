'Abdullah to lead people in prayer and he accordingly used to lead them. Whenever he raised his head after bowing, he stood up equal to the time that I can recite (this supplication): O Allah! our Lord! unto Thee be the praise which would fill the heavens and the earth, and that which will please Thee besides them I Worthy art Thou of all praise and glory. None can prevent that which Thou bestowest, and none can bestow that whichthou preventest. And the greatness of the great will not avail him against Thee. Hakam (the narrator) said: I made a mention of that to Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Laila who reported: I heard al-Bara' b. 'Azib say that the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his bowing, and when he lifted his head from bowing, and his prostration, and between the two prostrations (all these acts) were nearly proportionate. I made a mention of that to 'Ar b. Murrah and he said: I saw Ibn Abi Laili (saying the prayer), but his prayer was not like this","grades":[],"reference":{"book":4,"hadith":220}}]}
