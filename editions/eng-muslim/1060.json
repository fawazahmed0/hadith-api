He (Thabit) said: Anas used to do that which I do not see you doing; when he lifted his head from bowing he stood up (so long) that one would say: He has forgotten (to baw down in prostration). And when he lifted his head from prostration, he stayed in that position, till someone would say: He has forgotten (to bow down in prostration for the second sajda)",
