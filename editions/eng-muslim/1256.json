We ate it to our heart's content and then made our way towards the mosque. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sensed its odour and he said: He who takes anything of this offensive plant must not approach us in the mosque. The people said: Its (use) has been forbidden; its (use) bu been forbidden. This reached the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he said: O people, I cannot forbid (the use of a thing) which Allah has made lawful, but (this garlic) is a plant the odour of which is repugnant to me",
