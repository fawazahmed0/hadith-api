'Auf heard Abu Huraira say:(When) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (wished to invoke curse or blessing on someone, he would do so at the end) of the recitation in the dawn prayer, when he had pronounced Allah-o-Akbar (for bending) and then lifted his head (saying):\" Allah listened to him who praised Him; our Lord! to Thee is all praise\" ; he would then stand up and say:\" Rescue al-Walid b. Walid, Salama b. Hisham, and 'Ayyash b. Abd Rabi'a, and the helpless among the Muslims. O Allah! trample severely Mudar and cause them a famine (which broke out at the time) of Joseph. O Allah! curse Lihyan, Ri'l, Dhakwan, 'Usayya, for they disobeyed Allah and His Messenger.\" (The narrator then adds): The news reached us that he abandoned (this) when this verse was revealed:\" Thou but no concern in the matter whether He turns to them (mercifully) or chastises them; surely they are wrongdoers\" (ill. 127)",
