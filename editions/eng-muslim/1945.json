			"text": "Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported:I observed prayer in danger with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). We drew ourselves up in two rows, one row behind him with the enemy between us and the Qibla. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) said: Allah is Most Great, and we all said it. He then bowed and we all bowed. He then raised his head from bowing, we all raised (our heads). He then went down in prostration along with the row close to him, and the rear row faced the enemy; then when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) completed the prostration, ; and then stood up, the row near to him also did it; then went down the rear row in prostration; then they stood up; then the rear row went to the front and the front row went to the rear. Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) bowed down and we all bowed. He then raised his head from bowing and we also raised (our heads). He and the row close to him which I had been in the rear then went down in prostration In the first rak'ah, whereas the rear row faced the enemy. And when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the rear row close to him had finished the prostration, the rear row went down and prostrated themselves; then the Messenger of Allah pronounced the salutation and we also pronounced the salutation. (Jabir said we hadith) as your guards behave with their chiefs",
