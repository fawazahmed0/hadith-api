Abdullah said:When Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon him) delivered the sermon, his eyes became red, his voice rose, and his anger increased so that he was like one giving a warning against the enemy and saying: \"The enemy has made a morning attack on you and in the evening too.\" He would also say: \"The Last Hour and I have been sent like these two.\" And he would join his forefinger and middle finger; and would further say: \"The best of the speech is embodied in the Book of Allah, and the best of the guidance is the guidance given by Muhammad. And the most evil affairs are their innovations; and every innovation is error.\" He would further say:, I am more dear to a Muslim even than his self; and he who left behind property that is for his family; and he who dies under debt or leaves children (in helplessness), the responsibility (of paying his debt and bringing up his children) lies on me","grades":[],"reference":{"book":7,"hadith":55}}]}
