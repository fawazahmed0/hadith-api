He said:Yes, I observed the Jumu`a prayer along with him in Maqsura and when the Imam pronounced salutation I stood up at my place and observed (Sunan rak`ahs). As he entered (the apartment) he sent for me and said: Do not repeat what you have done. Whenever you have observed the Jumu`a prayer, do not observe (Sunan prayer) till you, have talked or gone out, for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had ordered us to do this and not to combine two (types of) prayers without talking or going out",
