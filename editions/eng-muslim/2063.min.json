Abu Bakr scolded them. The Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) uncovered (his face) and said:Abu Bakr, leave them alone for these are the days of 'Id. And 'A'isha said: I recapitulate to my mind the fact that once the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) screened me with his mantle and I saw the sports of the Abyssinians, and I was only a girl, and so you can well imagine how a girl of tender age is fond of watching the sport","grades":[],"reference":{"book":8,"hadith":18}}]}
