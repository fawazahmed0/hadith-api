Rabah reported on the authority of 'A'isha, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him), who said:Whenever the wind was stormy, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to say: O Allah! I ask Thee for what is good in it, and the good which it contains, and the good of that which it was sent for. I seek refuge with Thee from what is evil in it, what evil it contains, and the evil of that what it was sent for; and when there was a thunder and lightning in the sky, his colour underwent a change, and he went out and in, backwards and forwards; and when the rain came, he felt relieved, and I noticed that (the sign of relief) on his face. 'A'isha asked him (about it) and he said: It may be as the people of 'Ad said: When they saw a cloud formation coming to their valley they said:\" It is a cloud which would give us rain\" (Qur'an, xlvi. 24)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":9,"hadith":16}}]}
