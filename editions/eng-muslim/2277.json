Walid and 'Abbas the uncle of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), refused (to pay it). Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Ibn Jamil is taking revenge but for this that he was destitute and Allah made him rich. As regards Khalid, you are unjust to Khalid, for be reserved his armours and weapons for the sake of Allah, and as for 'Abbas, I shall be responsible for it and an equal amount along with it. And he again said: 'Umar, bear this in mind, the uncle of a person is like his father",
