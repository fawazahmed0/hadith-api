And he while making a mention of ahadith reported from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said this:Sadaqa is due on every joint of a person, every day the sun rises. Administering of justice between two men is also a Sadaqa. And assisting a man to ride upon his beast, or helping him load his luggage upon it, is a Sadaqa; and a good word is a Sadaqa; and every step that you take towards prayer is a Sadaqa, and removing of harmful things from the pathway is a Sadaqa","grades":[],"reference":{"book":12,"hadith":72}}]}
