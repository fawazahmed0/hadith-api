The hypocrites said: Verily Allah does not stand in need of the charity of this, and the second one has done nothing but only made a show (of his charity). Then this verse was revealed.\" Those who scoff at the voluntary givers of charity among the believers as well as those who cannot find anything (to give) but with their hard labour\" (ix. 80). And Bishr did not utter the word Muttawwi'in",
