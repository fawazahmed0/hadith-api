And when the spender (and the other narrator said, when the giver of charity) makes up his mind to give charity, it (coat-mail) becomes expanded for him. But when a miserly person intends to spend, it contracts and every ring grips the place where it is. For the giver of charity, this coat-of. mail expands to cover his whole body and obliterates even his footprints. Abu Huraira said:(The miserly man) tries to expand it (the coat-of-mail) but it does not expand","grades":[],"reference":{"book":12,"hadith":96}}]}
