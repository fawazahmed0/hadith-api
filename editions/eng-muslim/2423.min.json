A person said: Messenger of Allah, does good produce evil? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remained silent. And it was said to him (the man who had asked the question from the Holy Prophet): What Is the matter with you, that you speak with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) but he does not speak with you? We thought as if revelation was descending upon him. He regained himself and wiped the sweat from him and said: He was the inquirer (and his style of expression showed as if he praised him and then added): Verily good does not produce evil. Whatever the spring rainfall causes to grow kills or is about to kill, but that (animal) which feeds on vegetation. It eats till its flanks are filled; it faces the sun and dungs and urinates. and then returns to eat. And this Wealth is a sweet vegetation, and it is a good companion for a Muslim who gives out of it to the needy, to the orphan. to the wayfarer, or something like that as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who takes it without his right is like one who eats but does not feel satisfied, and it would stand witness against him on the Day of judgment","grades":[],"reference":{"book":12,"hadith":160}}]}
