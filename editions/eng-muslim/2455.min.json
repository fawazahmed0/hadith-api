Yasar came to Abu Sa'id al-Khudri and asked him about Haruriya, saying:Did you hear the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) making a mention of them?

And they would recite the Qur'an which would not go beyond their throats and would swerve through the religion (as blank) just as a (swift) arrow passes through the prey.
