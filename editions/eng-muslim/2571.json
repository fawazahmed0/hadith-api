The people among Muslims also observed uninterrupted fast. This (news) reached him (the Holy Prophet) and he said:Had the month been lengthened for me I would have continued observing Saum Wisal, so that those who act with forced hardness would (have been obliged) to abandon it. You are not like me (or he said): I am not like you. I continue to do so (in a state) that my Lord feeds me and provides me drink",
