Zubair reported that he had heard 'A'isha, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), as saying:A person came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the mosque during (the month of) Ramadan and said: Messenger of Allah, I am burnt, I am burnt, whereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked him as to what the matter was. Upon this he said: I had intercourse with my wife (in a state of fasting) Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Give charity. Upon this he said: Apostle of Allah, I swear by God, there is nothing with me (to give in charity) as I do not possess anything. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Sit down. So he sat down and he was in this very state when there came a person urging a donkey with a load of eatables upon it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Where is that burnt one who was just here? Thereupon the person stood up. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Give this (eatables brought by the man) in charity. Upon this the person said: Messenger of Allah, can there be anyone else (more deserving than I)? By Allah. we are hungry, we have nothing with us. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: Then eat (these eatables)",
