He saw a wild ass. As he was mounting his horse he asked his companions to pick up for him his whip (which had dropped) but they refused to do so. He asked them to hand him over the spear, but they refused. He then himself took hold of it and chased the wild ass and killed it. Some of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) ate (its meat), but some of them refused to do so. They overtook the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and asked him about it, and he said:It is a food which Allah provided you (so eat it)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":62}}]}
