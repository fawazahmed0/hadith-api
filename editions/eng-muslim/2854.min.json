I attacked It with a spear and held it, and begged for their (i. e. of his companions) assistance, but they refused to help me and we ate its meat. But we were afraid lest we should be separated (from the Messenger of Allah). So I proceeded on (with a view to) seeking the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Some- times I'dashed my horse and sometimes I made it run at a leisurely pace (keeping pace with others). (In the meanwhile) I met a person from Banfu Ghifar in the middle of the night.
