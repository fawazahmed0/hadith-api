Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said:Do these vermins trouble you? I said: Yes. Thereupon he said: Then shave your head; and it was in connection with me that this verse was revealed:\" Whoever among you is sick or has an ailment of the head, he (may effect) a compensation by fasting or alms or a sacrifice\". He (the Holy Prophet, therefore) said to me: Observe fast for three days or give a quantity of alms enough to feed six needy persons or offer sacrifice (of an animal) that is available",
