As I was at Sarif or near it, I entered in the state of menses. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) came to me and I was weeping, whereupon he said: Are you in a state of menses? I said. Yes. whereupon he said: This is what Allah has ordained for all the daughters, of Adam. Do whatever the pilgrim does. except that you should not circumambulate the House till you have washed yourself (at the end of the menses period). And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered sacrifice of a cow on behalf of his wives",
