'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: The flesh of cow was sent to us on the Day of Sacrifice (10th of Dhu'I-Hijja). I said. What is this? It was said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sacrificed (the cow) on behalf of his wives. Yahya said: I made a mention of this hadith (what has been stated by Umra) to Qasim b. Muhammad, whereupon be said: By Allah, she has rightly narrated it to you",
