When we reached Mecca we circumambulated the House and (ran) between al-Safa and al-Marwa. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who has no sacrificial animal with him should put off lhram. We said: What kind of putting off? He said: Getting out of lhram completely. So we came to our wives, and put on our clothes and applied perfume. When it was the day of Tarwiya, we put on Ihram for Hajj. and the first circumambulation and (running) between al-Safa and al-Marwa sufficed us.. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commanded us to become seven partners (in the sacrifice) of a camel and a cow",
