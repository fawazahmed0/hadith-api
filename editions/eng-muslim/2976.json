If I live you conceal (the fact that these have been transmitted by me), and if I die, then you narrate them if you like (and these are): I am blessed, and bear in mind that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) combined Hajj and Umra. Then no verse was revealed in regard to it in the Book of Allah (which abrogated it) and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not forbid (from doing it). And whatever a person (, Umar) said was out of his personal opinion",
