Ibn 'Umar said: Yes. whereupon he said: Ibn Abbas, however, says: Do not circumambulate the House until you come to stay at 'Arafat. Thereupon Ibn 'Umar said: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) Performed the Hajj and circumambulated the House before coming to stay (at 'Arafat). If you say the Truth, is it more rightful to follow the saying of the Prophet (ﷺ) or the words of Ibn Abbas?",
