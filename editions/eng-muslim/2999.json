Dinar said:We asked Ibn Umar about a person who came for Umra and circumambulated the House, but he did not run between al-Safa' and al-Marwa, whether he is allowed to (put off Ihram) and have intercourse with his wife. He replied: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) circumambulated the House seven times and offered two rak'ahs of prayer after staying (at 'Arafat), and ran between al-Safa and al-Marwa seven times.\" Verily there is in Allah's Messenger a model pattern for you\" (xxxill. 21)",
