He said: On the authority uf Allah's words:\" Then their place of sacrifice is the Ancient House\" (al-Qur'an, xxii. 33). I said: It concerns the time after staying at 'Arafat, whereupon he said: Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) had stated (that the place of sacrifice is the Ancient House) ; it way be after staying at 'Arafat or before (staying there).
