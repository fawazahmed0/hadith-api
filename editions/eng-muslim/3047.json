'Umar) informed him that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) turned his face to the two hillocks which intervened between him and the long mountain by the side of the Ka'ba, and the mosque which had been built there was thus on the left of the hillock. Allah's Messenger's (ﷺ) place of prayer was lower than the black hillock, at a distance of ten cubits or near it. He (ﷺ) would then observe prayer facing these two hillocks of the long mountain that is intervening between you and the Ka'ba",
