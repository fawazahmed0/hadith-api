			"text": "Usama b. Zaid (Allah be pleased with him) reported:I was sitting behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on the riding animal from 'Arafat. As Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) reached the left side of the mountain which was situated near Muzdalifa, he made the camel kneel down and made water and then came back. I poured water and he, performed light ablution. I then said: Messenger of Allah, it is time for prayer. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: The prayer awaits you (at the next station, Muzdalifa). Allah's Messenger (may peaced be upon him) rode on until he came to Muzdalifa and observed prayer. Then al-Fadl (Allah be pleased with him) sat behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and reached (Muzdalifa) in the morning. Kuraib said: 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) narrated from al-Fadl (Allah be pleased with him) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) continued pronouncing Talbiya until he reached al-Jamara (al-'Aqaba)",
