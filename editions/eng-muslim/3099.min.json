I said to him: Prayer, whereupon he said: The prayer awaits you (at Muzdalifa). So he rode again, and as he came to Muzdalifa, he got down and performed ablution well. Then Iqima was pronounced for prayer, and he 'observed the sunset prayer. Then every person made his camel kneel down there, and then Iqama was pronounced for 'Isha' prayer and he observed it, and he (the Holy Prophet) did not observe any prayer (either Sunan or Nawifil) in between them (He observed the Fard of sunset and 'Isha' prayers successively)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":304}}]}
