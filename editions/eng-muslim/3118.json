He (Allah's Apostle) gave her the permission. So she set forth before his (Holy Prophet's) departure. But we stayed there until it was dawn and we moved on, when he departed. And if I were to seek the permission of Allah's Messenger. (ﷺ) as Sauda had sought permission, I could have also gone with his permission and it would have been better for me than that for which I was happy",
