'Amr b. al-'As (Allah be pleased with them) reported:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stopped while riding his camel and the people began to ask him.

Then another (person) came saying: I did not know that the animal was to be sacrificed before shaving, but I got myself shaved before sacrificing the animal, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Sacrifice the animal (now) and there is no harm in it. He (the narrator) said: I did not hear that anything was asked on that day (shout a matter) which a person forgot and could not observe the sequence or anything like it either due to forgetfulness or ignorance, but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said (about that): Do it; there is no harm in it","grades":[],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":361}}]}
