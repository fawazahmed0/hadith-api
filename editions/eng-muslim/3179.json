'Abdullah al-Muzani said:While I was sitting along with Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) near the Ka'ba, there came a bedouin to him and said: What is the matter that I see that the progeny of your uncle supply honey and milk (as drink to the travellers), whereas you supply al-nabidh (water sweetened with dates)? Is it due to your poverty or due to your close-fistedness? Thereupon Ibn 'Abbas said: Allah be praised, it is neither due to poverty nor due to close-fistedness (but due to the fact) that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) came here riding his she-came, and there was sitting behind him Usama. He asked for water, and we gave him a cup full of nabidh and he drank it, and gave the remaining (part) to Usama; and he (the Holy Prophet) said: You have done Food, You have done well. So continue doing like it So we do not like to change what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had commanded us to do",
