			"text": "Amra daughter of Abd al-Rahman reported that Ibn Ziyad had written to 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with him) that 'Abdullah b. Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) bad said that he who sent a sacrificial animal (to Mecca) for him was forbidden what is forbidden for a pilgrim (in the state of Ihram) until the animal is sacrificed I have myself sent my sacrificial animal (to Mecca), so write to me your opinion. Amra reported 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) as saying:It is not as Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) had asserted, for I wove the garlands for the sacrificial animals of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) with my own hands. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then garlanded them with his own hands, and then sent them with my father, and nothing was forbidden for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) which had been made lawful for him by Allah until the animals were sacrificed",
