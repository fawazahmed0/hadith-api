He set out and came back and said: Messenger of Allah, what should I do with those who are completely exhausted and become powerless to move on, whereupon he said: Slaughter them, and dye their hoofs in their blood, and put them on the sides of their humps, but neither you nor anyone among those who are with you must eat any part of them","grades":[],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":420}}]}
