Talha, the keeper (of the Ka'ba), were along with him. He closed the door and stayed in it for some time. Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) said:I asked Bilal as he came out what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had done there. He said: He prayed there in (such a position) that two pillars were on his left side, one pillar on his right, and three pillars were behind him, and the House at that time was resting on six pillars",
