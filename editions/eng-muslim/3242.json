			"text": "A'isha, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as having said this:Didn't you see that when your people built the Ka'ba, they reduced (its area with the result that it no longer remains) on the foundations (laid) by Ibrahim. I said: Messenger of Allah, why don't you rebuild it on the foundations (laid by) Ibrahim? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Had your people not been new converts to Islam, I would have done that. 'Abdullah b. 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) said: If 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) had heard it from Allah's Messenger (may peace be up (vn him), I would not have seen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) abandoning the touching of the two corners situated near al-Hijr, but (for the fact) that it was not completed on the foundations (laid) by Ibrihim",
