Jubair reported that Marwan b. al-Hakam (Allah be pleased with him) addressed people and made mention of Mecca and its inhabitants and its sacredness, but he made no mention of Medina, its inhabitants and its sacredness. Rafi' b. Khadij called to him and said:What is this that I hear you making mention of Mecca and its inhabitants and its sacredness, but you did not make mention of Medina and its inhabitants and its sacredness, while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has also declared sacred (the area) between its two lava lands (Medina)? And (we have record of this) with us written on Khaulani parchment. If you like, I can read it out to you. Thereupon Marwan became silent, and then Said: I too have heard some part of it","grades":[],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":520}}]}
