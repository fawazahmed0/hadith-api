And he must not offer a price for a thing for which his brother had already offered a price; and a woman must not be combined in marriage with her father's sister, nor with her mother's sister, and a woman must not ask to have her sister divorced in order to deprive her of what belongs to her, but she must marry, because she will have what Allah has decreed for her",
