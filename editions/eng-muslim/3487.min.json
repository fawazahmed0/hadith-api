Sa'd al-Sa'idi (Allah be pleased with him) reported:A woman came to Allah's Messenger. (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, I have come to you to entrust myself to you (you may contract my marriage with anyone at your discretion). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw her and cast a glance at her from head to foot. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then lowered his head. When the woman saw that he had made no decision in regard to her, she sat down. There stood up a person from amongst his companions and said: Messenger of Allah, marry her to me if you have no need of her. He (the Prophet) said: is there anything with you (which you con give as a dower)? He said: No, Messenger of Allah, by Allah I have nothing. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Go to your people (family) and see if you can find something. He returned and said: I have found nothing. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: See even if it is an iron ring. He went and returned and said: No, by Allah, not even an iron ring, but only this lower garment of mine (Sahl said that he had no upper garment), half of which (I am prepared to part with) for her. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: How can your lower garment serve your purpose, for it you wear it, she would not be able to make any use of it and if she wears it there would not be anything on you? The man sat down and as the sitting prolonged he stood up (in disappointment) and as he was going back Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commanded (him) to be called back, and as he came, he said to him: Do you know any part of the Qur'an? He said: I know such and such surahs (and he counted them), whereupon he (ﷺ) said: Can you recite them from heart (from your memory)? He said: Yes, whereupon he (Allah's Messenger) said: Go, I have given her to you in marriage for the part of the Qur'an which you know","grades":[],"reference":{"book":16,"hadith":89}}]}
