Afterwards she married Abd at-Rahman b. al-Zubair (Allah be pleased with him), She came to Allah'sApostle (may peace be upon him and said to Allah's messenger (ﷺ) that she had been the wife of Rifa'a (Allah be pleased with him) and he had divorced her by three pronouncements and afterwards she married 'Abd al-Rahman b. al-Zubair. By Allah, all he possesses is like the fringe of a garment, and she took hold of the fringe of her garment. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) laughed and said:Perhaps you wish to return to Rifa'a, (but you) cannot (do it) until he has tasted your sweetness and you have tasted his sweetness. Abu Bakr al-siddiq (Allah be pleased with him) was sitting at that time with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Khalid b. Sa'id b. al-'As (Allah be pleased with him) was sitting at the door of his apartment and he was not permitted to (enter the room), and Kbalid called loudly saying: Abu Bakr, why don't you scold her for what she is saying loudly in the presence of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?",
