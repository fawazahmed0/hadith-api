(At this juncture) Ma'qil said: I am going to narrate to you a hadith which I have heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and which I would not have transmitted if I knew that I would survive. Verily I have heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: There is none amongst the bondsmen who was entrusted with the affairs of his subjects and he died in such a state that he was dishonest in his dealings with those over whom he ruled that the Paradise is not forbidden for him",
