			"text": "Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported:I married a woman during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (may peace be. upon him). I met the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), whereupon he said: Jabir, have you married? I said: Yes. He said: A virgin or one previously marrried? I said: With due previously married, whereupon he said: Why did you not marry a virgin with whom you could sport? I said: Allah's Messenger, I have sisters; I was afraid that she might intervene between me and them, whereupon he said: Well and good, if it is so. A woman is married for four reasons, for her religion, her property, her status, her beauty, so you should choose one with religion. May your hands cleave to dust",
