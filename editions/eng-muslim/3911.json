Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbidding Muhaqala, and Muzabana, and Mukhabara, and the buying of date-palm until its fruit is ripened (ripening means that its colour becomes red or yellow, or it is fit for being eaten). And Muhaqala implies that crops in the field are bought for grains according to a customary measure. Muzabana implies that date-palm should be sold for dry dates by measuring them with wisqs, and al-Mukhabara is (a share), maybe one-third or one-fourth (in produce) or something like it. Zaid (one of the narrators) said to Ata' b. Abu Rabah (the other narrator):Did You bear Jabir b. Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) making a mention of it that he had heard it directly from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? He said: Yes",
