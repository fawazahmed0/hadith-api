			"text": "Ibn Umar reported that 'Umar b. al-Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) expelled the Jews and Christians from the land of Hijaz, and that when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) conquered Khaibar he made up his mind to expel the Jews from it (the territory of Khaibar) because, when that land was conquered, it came under the sway of Allah, that of His Messenger (ﷺ) and that of the Muslims. The jews asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to let them continue there on the condition that they would work on it, and would get in turn half of the fruit (of the trees), whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:We would let you continue there so long as we will desire. So they continued (to cultivate the lands) till 'Umar externed them to Taima' ang Ariha (two villages in Arabia, but out of Hijaz)",
