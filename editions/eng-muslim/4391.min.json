Hamal b. al-Nabigha al-Hudhali said:Messenger of Allah, why should I play blood-wit for one who neither drank, nor ate, nor spoke, nor made any noise; it is like a nonentity (it is, therefore, not justifiable to demand blood-wit for it). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: He seems to be one of the brothers of soothsavers on account of the rhymed speech which he has composed","grades":[],"reference":{"book":28,"hadith":50}}]}
