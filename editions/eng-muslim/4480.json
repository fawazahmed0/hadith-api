Rabi', came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said:Allah's Messenger, by Allah, there was no household upon the surface of the earth than your household about which I cherished that it should be disgraced. But today there is no household on the surface of the earth than your household about which I cherish that it be honoured Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said. It will increase, by Him in Whose Hand is my life.
