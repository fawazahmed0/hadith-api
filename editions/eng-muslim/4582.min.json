Abu Bakr said to her:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:\" We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is Sadaqa (charity).\" The narrator said: She (Fatima) lived six months after the death of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and she used to demand from Abu Bakr her share from the legacy of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) from Khaibar, Fadak and his charitable endowments at Medina. Abu Bakr refused to give her this, and said: I am not going to give up doing anything which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to do. I am afraid that it I go against his instructions in any matter I shall deviate from the right course. So far as the charitable endowments at Medina were concerned, 'Umar handed them over to 'Ali and Abbas, but 'Ali got the better of him (and kept the property under his exclusive possession). And as far as Khaibar and Fadak were concerned 'Umar kept them with him, and said: These are the endowments of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (to the Umma). Their income was spent on the discharge of the responsibilities that devolved upon him on the emergencies he had to meet. And their management was to be in the hands of one who managed the affairs (of the Islamic State). The narrator said: They have been managed as such up to this day","grades":[],"reference":{"book":32,"hadith":63}}]}
