Then he began to return to him whatever he had received. (In this connection) my people told me to approach the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and ask from him what his people had given him or a portion thereof, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had bestowed those trees upon Umm Aiman. So I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he gave hem (back) to me. Umm Aiman (also) came (at this time). She put the cloth round my neck and said:No, by Allah, we will not give to, you what he has granted to me. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Umm Aiman, let him have them and for you are such and such trees instead. But she said: By Allah, there is no god besides Him. No, never! The Prophet (ﷺ) continued saying: (You will get) such and such. until he had granted her ten times or nearly ten times more (than the original gift)",
