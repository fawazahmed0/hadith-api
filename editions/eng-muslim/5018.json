On that very evening of the day when they had been granted victory, they lit many fires. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: What are those fires and what for those have been lit? They said: (These have been lit) for (cooking) the flesh. Thereupon he said: Of what flesh? They said: For the flesh of the domestic asses. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace bo upon him) said: Throw that away and break them (the earthen pots in which the fiesa was being cooked). A person said: Messenger of Allah, should we throw it away and wash them (the cooking pots)? He said: You may do so",
