Jubair reported that Ibn 'Umar happened to pass by some young men of the Quraish who had tied a bird (and th, is made it a target) at which they had been shooting arrows Every arrow that they missed came into the possession of the owner of the bird. So no sooner did they see Ibn 'Umar they went away. Thereupon Ibn 'Umar said:Who has done this? Allah has cursed him who does this. Verily Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) invoked curse upon one who made a live thing the target (of one's marksmanship)",
