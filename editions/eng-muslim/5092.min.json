Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Make haste or be careful (in making arrangements for procuring knives) which would let the blood flow (and along with it) the name of Allah is also to be recited.

He (the narrator) said: There fell to our lot as spoils of war camels and goats, and one of the camels among them became wild. A person (amongst usl struck It with an arrow which brought it under control. whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: This camel became wild like wild animals, so if you find any animal getting wild, you do the same with that","grades":[],"reference":{"book":35,"hadith":29}}]}
