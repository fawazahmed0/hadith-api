Thereupon he (liadrat 'All) was enraged and said: Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) did not tell me anything in secret that he hid from people, except that he told me four things.

He said: Allah cursed him who cursed his father; Allah cursed him who sacrificed for anyone besides Allah; and Allah cursed him who accommodates an innovator (in religion) ; and Allah cursed him who changed the minarets (the boundary lines) of the land",
