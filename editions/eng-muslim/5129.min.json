'Ali reported 'Ali having said:There fell to my lot a she-camel out of the spoils of war on the Day of Badr, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave me (another) she-camel on that day out of the Khums (one-fifth reserved for Allah and His Messenger). When I made up my mind to consummate my marriage with Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), I prevailed upon a goldsmith of the tribe of Qainuqa' to go along with me so that we might bring Idhkhir wishing to sell that to the goldsmiths and thus I should be able to arrange my wedding feast. While I was arranging the equipments. i. e. litters, sacks and ropes, my two she-camels were sitting down at the side of the apartment of a person of the Ansar. I collected (the different articles of equipment) and found to my surprise that their humps had been chopped off and their haunches had been cut off and their livers had been taken out. I could not help weeping when I saw that plight of theirs. I said: Who has done that? They said: Hamza b. 'Abd al-Muttalib has done this. and he is in this house dead drunk in the company of some of the Ansair with asinging girl singing before him and his companions. She said in her song: O Hamza. get up and attack these falty she-camels. Thereupon Hamza stood up with a sword (in his hand) and cut off their humps and ripped their haunches and tore out their livers. 'Ali said: I went away until I came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and there was with him Zaid b. Haritha. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) recognised from my face what I had experienced, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: What has happened to you? I said: Messenger of Allah, by Allah, I have never seen (such an unfortunate day) as this day. Hamza has committed aggression to my she-camels, and has cut off their humps. and ripped their haunches, and he is in a house in the company of some drunkards. (Hearing this) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent for his mantle and, putting it on him, he proceeded, and I and Zaid b. Haritha followed him, until he came to the door (of the house) in which there was Hamza. He (the Holy Prophet) sought permission which they granted him. and they were all drunk. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) began to reprimand Hamza for what he had done. Hamza's eyes were red. He cast a glance at Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and then looked towards his knees. and then lifted his eyes and cast a glance at his waist and then lifted his eyes and saw his face. And then Hamza said: Are you anything but the slaves of my father? Alah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to know that he was intoxicated, and he thus turned upon his heels, and came out, and we also came out along with him","grades":[],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":3}}]}
