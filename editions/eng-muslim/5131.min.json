Malik reported:I was the cup-bearer of some people in the house of Abu Talha on the day when liquor was forbidden. Their liquor had been prepared from dry dates or fresh dates when the announcer made the announcement. He (Abu Talha) said to me: Go out and find out (what the announcement is). I got out (and found) an announcer making this announcement: Behold, liquor has been declared unlawful. He said: The liquor (was spilt and) flawed in the lanes of Medina. Abu Talha said to me: Go out and Spill it, and I spilt it. They said or some of them said: Such and such were killed, such and such were killed for (the wine) had been in their stomachs. He (the narrator) said. I do not know whether it is the narration transmitted by Anas, (or by someone else). Then Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed:\" There shall be no sin (imputed) unto those who have believed and done good works for what they may have eaten as long as they fear (Allah) and believe and do good works\" (v. 93)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":5}}]}
