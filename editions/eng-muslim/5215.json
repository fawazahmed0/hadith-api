			"text": "Abu Burda reported on the authority of his grandfather that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent him and Mu'adh b. Jabal to Yemen and said to them:Give good tidings to the (people). and make things easy (for them), teach (them), and do not repel (them) ; and I think he also said: Cooperate cheerfully with each other. When he (the Holy Prophet) turned his back, Abu Musa returned to him and said: Allah's Messenger, they (the people of Yemen) have a drink which is (made) from honey and which is prepared by cooking it until it coagulates, and Mizr is prepared from barley, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Every intoxicant that detains you from prayer is forbidden",
