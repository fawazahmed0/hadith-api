Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked whether that was intoxicating. He said:Yes. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Every intoxicant is forbidden. Verily Allah the Exalted and Majestic, made a covenant to those who drank intoxicants to make their drink Tinat al-Khabal. They said: Allah's Messenger, what is Tinat a]-Khabal? He said: It is the sweat of the denizens of Hell or the discharge of the denizens of Hell",
