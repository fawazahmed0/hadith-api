When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) talked to her, she said: I seek refuge with Allah from you. Thereupon he said: I (have decided to) keep you away from me. They (the people near her) said: Do you know who he is? She said: No. They said: He is the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He came to you in order to give you the proposal of marriage.

'Abd al-'Aziz asked him to give that (cup) as a gift to him and he gave (it to) him as a gift. In the narration of Abu Bakr b. Ishaq (the words) are:\" Sahl, serve us drink",
