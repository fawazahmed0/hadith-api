			"text": "Anas reported:The Apostle of Allah (may peace he upon him) came to Medina when I was ten years old and he died when I was twenty years old. My mother exhorted me to serve him. He (the Holy Prophet) came to our house, and we ruined a flabby goat for him and mixed it (the milk) with water from the well of the house. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) drank that. Umar and Abu Bakr on his left side said to him: Allah's Messenger, give it to Abu Bakr, but he (the Holy Prophet) gave it to the desert Arab who was on his right. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: He who is on the right, then he who is on the right",
