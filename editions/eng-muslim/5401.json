Upon this. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: go who wears it has no share (of reward) in the Hereafter. Then these garments were sent to Allah\" s Messenger (ﷺ), and he presented one of these silk garment to Umar. Thereupon Umar said: You make me wear (this silk garment) Whereas you said about the silk garment of Utarid (the person who had been busy selling this garment at the door of the mosque) what you had to say, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: I have not presented you this for wearing it (but to make use of its price) ; so 'Umar presented it to his polytheist brother in Mecca",
