Umar said:Allah's Messenger I saw 'Utarid standing in the market with a silk garment; would that you buy and wear it for (receiving) the delegations of Arabs when they visit you? I (the narrator) said: I think he ('Umar) also said: You may wear it on Friday (also). Thereupon, Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon him) said: He who wears silk in this world has no share in the Hereafter. Later on when these silk garments were presented to Allah's Massenger (ﷺ) he presented one silk garment to 'Umar and presented one also to Usama b. Zaid and gave one to 'Ali b. Abu 'Talib. saying: Tear them and make head coverings for your ladies. 'Umar came carrying his garment and said: Allah's Messenger, you have sent it to me, whereas you had said yesterday about the (silk) garment of Utarid what you had to say. He (the Holy Prophet) said: I have not sent it to you that you wear it, but I have sent It to you so that you may derive benefit out of it; and Usama (donned) the garment (presented to him) and appeared to be brisk, whereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) looked at him with a look by which he perceived that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not like what he had done. He said: Allah's Messenger. why is it that you look at me like this. whereas you yourself presented it to me? He said: I never sent it to you to wear it, but I sent It to you so that you may tear it and make out head covering for your ladies","grades":[],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":18}}]}
