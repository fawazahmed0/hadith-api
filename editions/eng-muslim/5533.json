I perceived or I was made to perceive upon his face signs of disgust. She said:Allah's Messenger, I offer repentance to Allah and His Messenger. (but tell me) what is the sin that I have committed. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: What is this carpet? She said: I bought it for you so that you might sit on it and take rest.
