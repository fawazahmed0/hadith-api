			"text": "Umm Qais, daughter of Mihsan, the sister of 'Ukasha b. Mihsan said:I visited Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) along with my son who had not, by that time, been weaned and he urinated over his (clothes). He ordered water to be brought and sprinkled (it) over them. She (further) said: I visited him (Allah's Apostle) along with my son and I had squeezed the swelling in the uvula, whereupon he said: Why do you afflict your children by compressing like this? Use this Indian aloeswood, for it contains seven types of remedies, one among them being a remedy for pleurisy. It is applied through the nose for a swelling of the uvula and poured into the side of the mouth for pleurisy",
