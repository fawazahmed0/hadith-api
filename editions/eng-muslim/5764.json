			"text": "Umm Qais, daughter of Mihsan, was one of the earlier female emigrants who had pledged allegiance to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). She was the sister of Ukasha b. Mihsan, one of the posterity of Asad b. Khuzaima. She reported that she came to Allah's messenger (ﷺ) along with her son who had not attained the age of weaning and she had compressed the swelling of his uvula. (Yunus said:She compressed the uvula because she was afraid that there might be swelling of uvula.) Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Why do you afflict your children by compressing in this way? You should use Indian aloeswood, for it has seven remedies in it, one of them being the remedy for pleurisy. Ubaidullah reported that she had told that that was the child who had urinated in the lap of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called for water and sprinkled it on his urine, but he did not wash it well",
