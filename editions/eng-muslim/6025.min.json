Malik reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:A child was born into me this night and I named him after the name of my father Ibrihim. He then sent him to Umm Saif, the wife of a blacksmith who was called Abu Saif. He (the Holy Prophet) went to him and I followed him until we reached Abu Saif and he was blowing fire with the help of blacksmith's bellows and the house was filled with smoke. I hastened my step and went ahead of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said: Abu Saif, stop it, as there comes Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon him). He stopped and Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) called for the child. He embraced him and said what Allah had desired. Anas said: I saw that the boy breathed his last in the presence of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). The eyes of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) shed tears and he said: Ibrahim, our eyes shed tears and our hearts are filled with grief, but we do not say anything except that by which Allah is pleased. O Ibrahim, we are grieved for you","grades":[],"reference":{"book":43,"hadith":83}}]}
