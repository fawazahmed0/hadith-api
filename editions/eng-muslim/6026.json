He used to go there and we accompanied him. He entered the house, and it was filled with smoke as his foster-father was a bricksmith. He took him (his son Ibrihim) and kissed him and then came back. 'Amr said that when Ibrihim died. Allah's LMessenger (ﷺ) said: Ibrihim is my son and he dies as a suckling babe. He has now two foster-mothers who would complete his suckling period in Paradise",
