Some of the persons said: Abu Bakr was older than Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). 'Abdullah said: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) died when he was sixty-three, and Abu Bakr died when he was sixty-three and so 'Umar fell as a martyr when he was sixty-three. A person from the people who was called 'Amir b. Sa'd reported that Jabir had said: We were sitting with Mu'awiya that there was a discussion about the age of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).
