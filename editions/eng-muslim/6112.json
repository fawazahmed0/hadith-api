			"text": "Urwa b. Zubair reported that 'Abdullah b. Zubair had narrated to him that a person from the Ansar disputed with Zubair in the presence of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in regard to the watering places of Harra from which they watered the date-palms. The Ansari said:Let the water flow, but he (Zubair) refused to do this and the dispute was brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he said to Zubair: Zubair, water (your date-palms), then let the water flow to your neighbor. The Ansari was enraged and said: Allah's Messenger, (you have given this decision) for he is the son of your father's sister. The face of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) underwent a change, and then said: Zubair, water (your date-palms), then hold it until it rises up to the walls. Zubair said: I think, by Allah, that this verse:\" Nay, by the Lord, they will not (really) (believe) until they make thee a judge of what is in dispute among them, and find in this no dislike of what thou decidest and submit with full submission\" (iv. 65)",
