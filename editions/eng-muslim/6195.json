He took hold of the leathern bucket from my hand so that he should serve water to the people. He drew two bucketfuls and there was some weakness in his drawing (Allah may forgive him). Then there came Ibn Khattab and he took hold of that, and I did not see a person stronger than he (drawing water) until the people went away with their thirst quenched and the tank filled with water",
