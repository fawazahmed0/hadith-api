Waqqas reported that Umar sought permission from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to visit him when some women of the Quraish were busy in talking with him and raising their voices above his Voiee. When'Umar sought permission they stood up and went hurriedly behind the curtain. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave him permission smilingly. Thereupon 'Umar said:Allah's Messenger, may Allah keep you happy all your life. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: I wonder at these women who were with me and no sooner did they hear your voice, they immediately went behind the curtain. Thereupon 'Umar said: Allah's Messenger, you have more right that they should fear you. Then Umar (addressing the women) said: O ye enemies of yourselves, do you fear me and fear not the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? They said: Yes, you are harsh and strict as compared to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Thereupon, Allah's Messenger (maypeace be upon him) said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if satan would encounter you in the way he would certainly take a different way from that of yours",
