Abdullah came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon -him) and asked him to give his shirt which should be used for the coffin of his father. He gave that to him. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood up to say prayer over him Thereupon I Umar caught hold of the clothe of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said:Allah's Messenger, are you going to offer prayer, whereas Allah has forbidden to offer prayer for him, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Allah has given me a choice saying: Ask forgiveness for them or you may not ask for them; even if you ask for them seventy times, I will make an addition to the seventy. He was a hypocrite and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said prayer over him that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed the verse:\" And never pray over any one of them that has died and never should you stand by his grave\" (ix. 84)",
