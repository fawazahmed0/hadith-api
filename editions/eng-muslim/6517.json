(It was a common observation) that when anyone of us migrated (to Medina) he ceased to ask (too many questions) from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). So I asked him about virtue and vice. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Virtue is a kind disposition and vice is what rankles in your mind and that you disapprove of its being known to the people",
