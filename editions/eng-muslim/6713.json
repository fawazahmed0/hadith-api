Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: What preparation have you made for the Last Hour? He said: The love of Allah and of His Messenger (is my only preparation). Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: You would be along with one whom you love. Anas said: Nothing pleased us more after accepting Islam than the words of Allah's Apostle: You would be along with one whom you love. And Anas said. I love Allah and His Messenger and Abu Bakr and Umar, and I hope that I would be along with them although I have not acted like them",
