Sa'd reported on the authority of his father that a desert Arab came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said to him:Teach me the words which I should (often) utter. He said: Utter,\" There is no god but Allah, the One, having no partner with Him. Allah is the Greatest of the great and all praise is due to Him. Hallowed be Allah, the Lord of the worlds, there is no Might and Power but that of Allah, the All-Powerful and the Wise.\" He (that desert Arab) said: These all (glorify) my Lord. But what about me? Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: You should say:\" O Allah, grant me pardon, have mercy upon me, direct me to righteousness and provide me sustenance.\" Musa (one of the narrators) said: I think he also said:\" Grant me safety.\" But I cannot say for certain whether he said this or not. Ibn Abi Shaiba has not made a mention of the words of Musa in his narration","grades":[],"reference":{"book":48,"hadith":43}}]}
