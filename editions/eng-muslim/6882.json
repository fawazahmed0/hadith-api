I retreat unto Thee for protection with hope in Thee and fear of Thee. There is no resort and no deliverer (from hardship) but Thou only. I affirm my faith in Thine books which Thou revealed and in Thine Apostles whom Thou sent.\" Make this as the last word of yours (when you go to sleep) and in case you die during that night, you would die upon Fitra (upon Islam).
