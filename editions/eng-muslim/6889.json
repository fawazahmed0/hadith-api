O Allah, Thou art the First, there is naught before Thee, and Thou art the Last and there is naught after Thee, and Thou art Evident and there is nothing above Thee, and Thou art Innermost and there is nothing beyond Thee. Remove the burden of debt from us and relieve us from want.\" Abu Salih used to narrate it from Abu Huraira who narrated it from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ)",
