			"text": "Abdullah reported that when it was evening Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to supplicate:\" We have entered upon evening and so, too, the whole Kingdom of Allah has entered upon evening. Praise is due to Allah. There is no god but Allah, the One having no partner with Him.\" He (the narrator) said: I think that he also uttered (in this supplication these words):\" His is tne Sovercignty and to Him is praise due and He is Potent over everything. My Lord, I beg of Thee good that lies in this night and good that follows it and I seek refuge in Thee from the evil that lies in this night and from the evil of that which follows it. My Lord, I seek refuge in Thee from sloth, from the evil of vanity. My Lord, I seek refuge in Thee from torment of the Hell-Fire and from torment of the grave.\" And when it was morning he said like this:\" We entered upon morning and the whole Kingdom of Allah enter ed upon morning",
