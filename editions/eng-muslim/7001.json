It was (on this occasion) that this verse was revealed:\" And observe prayer at the (two) ends of the day and in the first hours of the night. Surely, good deeds take away evil deeds. That is a reminder for the mindful\" (xi. 115). That person said: Allah's Messenger, does it concern me only? He (the Holy Prophet) said: It concerns every one of my Unimah, who acts according to it",
