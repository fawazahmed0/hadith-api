They moved about in that land in search of water. There they saw a person who had been pulling his hair. The rest of the hadith is the same. And he (Dajjal) said:If I were to be permitted to set out I would have covered all the lands except Taiba. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) brought (Tamim Dari) before the public and he narrated to them and said: That is Taiba and that is the Dajjal",
