Thereupon 'Umar said: I know where it was revealed and on the day when it was revealed and where Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had been at that time when it was revealed. It was revealed on the day of 'Arafa (ninth of Dhu'l Hijjah) and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had been staying in 'Arafat. Sufyan said: I doubt, whether it was Friday or not (and the verse referred to) is this:\" Today I have perfected your religion for you and completed My favours upon you\" (v. 4)",
