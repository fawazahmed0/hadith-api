Had it been revealed in connection with the Jews, we would have taken it as the day of rejoicing. Thereupon he said: Which verse do you mean? He replied:\" This day I have perfected your religion for you and I have completed My favours upon you and I have chosen al-Islam as religion for you.\" Umar said, I know the day when it was revealed and the place where it was revealed. It was revealed to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at 'Arafat on Friday",
