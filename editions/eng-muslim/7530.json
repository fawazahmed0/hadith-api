And he (her guardian) did not give her in marriage because of her property and he tortured her and ill-treated her, it was in relation to her that (Allah said: )\" If you fear that you would not be able to observe equity in case of orphan girls, then marry whom you like among women,\" i. e. whatever I have made lawful for you and leave her whom you are putting to torture",
