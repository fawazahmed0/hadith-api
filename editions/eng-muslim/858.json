He (thenarrator) said:The person with me looked towards the enclosure, but saw nothing. I made a mention of that to my father. He said: If I knew that you would meet such a situation I would have never sent you (there), but (bear in wind) whenever you hear such a call (from the evil spirits) pronounce the Adhan. for I have heard Abu Huraira say that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upbn him) said: Whenever Adhan is proclaimed, Satan runs back vehemently",
