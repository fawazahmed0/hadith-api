Then I was taken up to Sidrah Al-Muntaha (the Lote-Tree of the Utmost Boundary). Its fruits were like Qilal [2] of Hajar and its leaves were like the ears of elephants. At its base were four rivers: Two hidden rivers and two manifest rivers. I asked Jibril (About them) and he said: 'The two hidden ones are in paradise, and the two manifest ones are the Euphrates and the Nile.' Then fifty prayers were enjoined upon me.

The Messenger of Allah said: 'As for that which was allocated to myself and to Banu 'Abdul-Muttalib, it is yours. When I have prayed Zuhr, stand up and say: \"We seek the help of the Messenger of Allah in dealing with the believers, or the Muslims, with regard to our women and children.\"' So when they prayed Zuhr, they stood up and said that.

Whoever gives back anything of these spoils of war, he will have six camels from the spoils of war that Allah grants us next.' Then he mounted his riding-animal and the people surrounded him, saying: 'Distribute our spoils of war among us.' They made him go back toward a tree on which his Rida' (upper-wrap) got caught. He said: 'O people! Give me back my Rida'. By Allah! If there were cattle as many in number as the trees of Tihamah I would distribute them among you, then you would not find me a miser, a coward or a liar.' Then he went to a camel and took a hair from its hump between two of his fingers and said: 'Look! I do not have any of the spoils of war. All I have is the Khums, and the Khums will be given back to you.' A man stood up holding a ball of yarn made from goat hair and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I took this to fix my camel-saddle.' He said: 'What was allocated to myself and to Banu 'Abdul-Muttalib is for you.' He said: 'Is this so important? I don't need it!' And he threw it down. He said: 'O people!
