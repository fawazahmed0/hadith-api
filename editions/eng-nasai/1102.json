He said the takbir and raised his hands until I saw his thumbs near his ears. When he wanted to bow, he said the takbir and raised his hands. Then he raised his head and said: 'Sami Allahu liman hamidah (Allah hears the one who praises Him).' Then he said the takbir and prostrated, and his hands were in the same position in relation to his ears as when he started the prayer",
