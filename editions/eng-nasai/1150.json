Then he said when he was standing: 'Rabbana lakal-hamd.' Then he said the takbir when he went down in prostration, then he said the takbir when he raised his head, and he did that throughout the entire prayer until he finished it, and he said the takbir when he stood up after the first two rak'ahs, after sitting",
