You are indeed Worthy of praise, Full of glory.)'\" (One of the narrators) 'abdur Rahman said: \"We used to say: 'And also upon us.'\" Abu Abdur-rahman (An Nasa'i) said: This is more worthy of being correct than the one that is before it. And we do not know of anyone who said \"Amr bin Murrah\" in it other than in this case. And Allah (SWT) knows best",
