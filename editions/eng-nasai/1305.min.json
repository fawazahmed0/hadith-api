Some of the people said to him: 'You made the prayer sort (or brief).' He said: 'Nevertheless I still recited supplications that I heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).' When he got up and left, a man -- he was my father but he did not name himself -- followed him and asked him about that supplication, then he came and told the people: \"Allāhumma bi `ilmikal-ghaiba wa qudratika 'alal-khalqi aḥyinī mā `alimtal-ḥayāta khairan lī, wa tawaffanī idhā `alimtal-wafāta khairan lī. Allāhumma wa 'as'aluka khashyataka fil-ghaibi wash-shahādati wa 'as'aluka kalimatal-ḥaqqi fir-riḍā'i wal ghaḍab, wa as'alukal-qaṣda fil faqri wal-ghina, wa 'as'aluka na`īman lā yanfadu wa 'as'aluka qurrata `ainin lā tanqaṭi`u wa as'alukar-riḍā'i ba`dal-qaḍā'i wa 'as'aluka bardal `aishi ba`dal-mawti, wa 'as'aluka ladhdhatan-naẓari ilā wajhika wash-shawqa ilā liqā'ika fī ghairi ḍarrā'a muḍirratin wa lā fitnatin muḍillatin, Allāhumma zayyinnā bizīnatil-īmāni waj`alna hudātan muhtadīn (O Allah, by Your knowledge of the unseen and Your power over creation, keep me alive so long as You know that living is good for me and cause me to die when You know that death is better for me. O Allah, cause me to fear You in secret and in public. I ask You to make me true in speech in times of pleasure and of anger. I ask You to make me moderate in times of wealth and poverty. And I ask You for everlasting delight and joy that will never cease. I ask You to make me pleased with that which You have decreed and for an easy life after death. I askYou for the sweetness of looking upon Your face and a longing to meet You in a manner that does not entail a calamity that will bring about harm or a trial that will cause deviation. O Allah, beautify us with the adornment of faith and make us among those who guide and are rightly guided)","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":13,"hadith":127}}]}
