When he had finished, he came and greeted the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with salam. He said: \"Go back and pray, for you have not prayed.\" So he went back and prayed, then he came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he said: \"Go back and pray, for you have not prayed.\" (This happened) two or three times. Then the man said to him: \"By the One who has honored you , O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I have tried my best; teach me.\" He said: \"When you get up to pray, perform wudu and do it well, then turn to face the Qiblah and say the takbir. Then recite the Quran, then bow until you are at ease in bowing. Then stand up until you are standing straight, then prostrate until you are at ease prostrating, then sit up until you are at ease sitting, then prostrate until you are at ease prostrating, then get up, and continue doing that until you have finished your prayer","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":13,"hadith":135}}]}
