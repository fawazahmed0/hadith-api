I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: 'I have lost my eyesight and the rainwater prevents me from reaching the masjid of my people. I would like you to come and pray in my house in a place that I can take as a masjid.' The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'I will do that, if Allah (SWT) wills.'

He did not sit own until he asked: 'Where would you like me to pray in your house?' I showed him the place where I wanted him to pray, so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood there and formed a row behind him, then he said the salam and we said the salam when he did",
