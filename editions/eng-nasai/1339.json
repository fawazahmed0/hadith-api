His is the Dominion, to Him be all praise, and He is able to do all things; there is no power and no strength except with Allah (SWT) the Almighty. There is none worthy of worship except Allah (SWT), and we worship none but Him, the source of blessing and kindness and the One Who is deserving of all good praise. There is none worthy of worship except Allah (SWT), and we are sincere in faith and devotion to Him even though the disbelievers detest it",
