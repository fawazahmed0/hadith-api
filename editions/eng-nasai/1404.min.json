Man yahdihillahu fala mudilla lahu wa man yudlil fala hadiya lahu. Wa ashhadu an la ilaha illallahu wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan 'abduhu wa rasuluhu. (Praise be to Allah, we seek His help and His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allah from the evil of our own souls and from our bad deeds. Whomsoever Allah guides will never be led astray,and whomsoever Allah leaves astray, no one can guide. I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.) Then he recited the following three verses: O you who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and die not except as Muslims; O Mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person, and from him he created his wife, and from them he created many men and women, and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship). Surely, Allah is Ever an All-Watcher over you); O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allah and fear Him, and speak (always) the truth","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":14,"hadith":41}}]}
