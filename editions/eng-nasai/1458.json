He saw some people offering voluntary prayers and said: What are these people doing? I said: They are offering voluntary prayers. He said: If I had wanted to pray before and after (the obligatory prayer) I would have offered it in full. I accompanied the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he did not pray more than two rak'ahs when traveling, and Abu Bakr (did likewise) until he died, as did 'Umar and 'Uthman, may Allah (SWT) be pleased with them all",
