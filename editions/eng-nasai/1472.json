Then he said: Sami Allahu liman hamidah, then he prostrated. In this manner, he bowed four times, and the eclipse ended before he had finished. Then he stood and addressed the people. He praised and glorified Allah (SWT), the Mighty and Sublime, as He deserves, then he said: The sun and moon are two of the signs of Allah (SWT), Most High. They do not become eclipsed for the death or birth of anyone. If you see that (eclipsed) then pray until it ends.
