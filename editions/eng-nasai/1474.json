He stood for a long time, then he bowed for a long time, then he stood for a long time, but it was shorter than the first standing, then he bowed for a long time but it was shorter than the first bowing. Then he stood up, then he prostrated, then he did the same in the second rak'ah, and when he finished the eclipse had ended. Then he addressed the people; he praised and glorified Allah (SWT), then he said: The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah (SWT). They do not become eclipsed for the death or birth of anyone. If you see that then call upon Allah (SWT), the Mighty and Sublime, and magnify Him, and give charity. Then he said: 'O Ummah of Muhammad! There is no one more jealous than Allah (SWT), the Mighty and Sublime, when his male or female slave commits zina. O Ummah of Muhammad! By Allah, if you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much",
