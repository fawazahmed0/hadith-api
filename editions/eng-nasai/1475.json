'Aishah said: \"The Prophet (ﷺ) went out, and the sun became eclipsed. We went out to another room and the women gathered with us. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to us and that was at the time of forenoon. He stood for a long time, then he bowed for a long time, then he raises his head and stood for a shorter time than the first one; then he bowed for a shorter time than the first one. Then he prostrated, then he stood up for the second (rak'ah) and did the same again, except that his bowing an prostrating were shorter than in the first rak'ah. Then he prostrated, and the eclipse had ended. When he had finished, he sat on the minbar and one of the things he said was: 'The people will be tried in their graves like the trial of the Dajjal.' Aishah siad: 'After that, we used to hear him seeking refuge with Allah (SWT) from the torment of the grave",
