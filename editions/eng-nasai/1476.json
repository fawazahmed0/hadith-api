When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came, I said: 'O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), will people be tormented in their graves?' He sought refuge with Allah (SWT) and climbed onto his mount. The sun became eclipsed while I was between the apartments with some women. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came from his mount and came to his prayer place, and led the people in prayer.He stood for a long time, then he bowed for a long time, then he raised his head and stood for a long time, then he bowed for a long time, then he raised his head and stood for a long time, then he prostrated for a long time. Then he stood for a shorter time than in the first (rak'ah), then he bowed for a shorter time than the first, then he raised his head and stood for a shorter time than the first, then he bowed for a shorter time than the first, then he raised his head and stood for a shorter time than the first, so he bowed four times and prostrated four times, and the eclipse ended. He said: \"You will be tried in your graves like the trial of the Dajjal.' Aishah said: 'I heard him after that seeking refuge with Allah from the torment of the grave",
