If Allah wills, we shall join you soon. Would that I had seen our brothers.\" They said: \"O Messenger of Allah, are we not your brother?\" He said: \"You are my Companions. My brothers are those who have not come yet. And I will reach the Hawd before you.\" They said: \"O Messenger of Allah, how will you know those of your Ummah who come after you?\" He said: \"Don't you think that if a man has a horse with a white blaze and white feet among horses that are solid black, he will recognize his horse?\" They said: \"Of course.\" He said: \"They will come on the Day of Resurrection with glittering white faces and glittering white hands and feet because of Wudu', and I will reach the Hawd before them",
