The people stood with him and he prayed two rak'ahs as they usually prayed. When the eclipse ended he addressed us and said 'The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah (SWT), with which He strikes fear into His slaves. They do not become eclipsed for the death or birth of anyone. If you see either of them being eclipsed, then pray and supplicate until it removed it from you",
