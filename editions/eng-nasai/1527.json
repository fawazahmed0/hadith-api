			"text": "It was narrated that Anas said:\"There was no rain for a year, so some of the Muslims went to the Prophet (ﷺ) one Friday and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, there has been no rain; the land has become bare and our wealth has been destroyed.' He raised his hands, and we did not see any cloud in the sky. He stretched forth his hands until I could see the whiteness of his armpits, praying to Allah (SWT) for rain. When we finished praying Jumu'ah, even a young man whose house nearby was worried about how he would get home. That lasted for a week, then on the following Friday they said: 'O Messenger of Allah, houses have been destroyed and all travel has been ceased.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled at how quickly the sons of Adam become weary, and he said with his hands raised: 'O Allah, around us and not on us,' and it dispersed from Al-Madinah",
