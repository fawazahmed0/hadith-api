			"text": "It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said:\"There was a drought during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). While the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was giving the Khutbah on the minbar one Friday, a Bedouin stood up and said: 'O Messenger of Allah wealth has been destroyed and our children are hungry; pray to Allah for us.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raised his hands, and we could not see even a wisp of a cloud in the sky, but by the One in Whose hand is my soul, he did not lower (his hands) before clouds like mountains appeared, and he did not come down from his minbar before we saw the rain dripping from his beard. It rained that day and the next day, and the day after, until the following Friday. Then that Bedouin\"- or he said, \"Someone else\"- \"stood up and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, buildings have been destroyed and wealth has drowned; pray to Allah (SWT) for us. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raised his hands and said: 'O Allah, around us and not on us.' He did not point in any direction but the clouds dispersed, until Al-Madinah became like a hole. And the valleys ran with water and no one came from any direction but he told us of the heavy rains",
