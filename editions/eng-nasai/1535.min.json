One group stood, although they were all behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and one group prostrated with him, then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up and they all stood with him. Then he bowed and they all bowed with him, then he prostrated and those who had been standing the first time prostrated with him. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and those who had prostrated with him at the end of their prayer sat, those who had been standing prostrated by themselves, then they sat and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said the taslim with all of them","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":18,"hadith":7}}]}
