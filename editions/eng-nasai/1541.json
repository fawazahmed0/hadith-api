He stood and said the takbir, and a group of us prayed behind him while another group was facing the enemy. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) bowed once and prostrated twice with them, then they moved away but did not say the taslim. They went to face the enemy and lined up in their places, and the other group came and formed a row behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he led them in praying, bowing once and prostrating twice. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said the taslim and he had bowed twice and prostrated four times. Then the two groups stood up and each man prayed by himself, bowing once and prostrating twice.\" Abu Bakr IB As-Sunni said: \"Az-Zuhri heard two hadiths from Ibn 'Umar, and he did not hear this from him",
