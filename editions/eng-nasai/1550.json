			"text": "It was narrated that Abu 'Ayyash Al-Zuraqi said:\"We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in 'Usfan and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in praying Zuhr. The idolaters were led that day by Khalid bin Al-Walid, and the idolaters said: 'We have caught them unawares.' Then the fear prayer was revealed between Zuhr and 'Asr. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in praying 'Asr and divided us into two groups, a group that prayed with the Prophet (ﷺ) and a group that guarded him. He said takbir with those who were closest to him and those who were guarding them, then he bowed and both groups bowed with him. Then those who were closest to him prostrated. Then they moved back and the others moved forward and prostrated. Then he stood and led them all in bowing, those who were closest to him and those who were guarding him. Then he led those who were closest to him in prostrating, then they moved back and took the place of their companions and the others came forward and prostrated. Then he said the taslim so each group had prayed two rak'ahs with their imam. And he offered the fear prayer once in the land of Banu Sulaym",
