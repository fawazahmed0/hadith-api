Then he should pray one rak'ah with them and they should pray another rak'ah by themselves, and prostrate twice where they are. Then they should go to where the others are and the others should come and he should lead them in bowing once and prostrating twice, so it will be two rak'ahs for him and one for them. Then they should bow once and prostrate twice (by themselves, to make up the other rak'ah)",
