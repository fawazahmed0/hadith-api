When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said the taslim at the end of his prayer, Khabbab said to him: 'May my father and mother be ransomed for you O Messenger of Allah, last night you offered a prayer the like of which I have never seen you offer.\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"Yes indeed. This is a prayer of hope and fear in which I asked my Lord, the Mighty and Sublime, for three things, of which He gave me two and did not grant me one. I asked my Lord not to destroy us with which he destroyed the nations before us, and He granted me that. And I asked my Lord not to let an enemy from without prevail over us, and He granted me that. And I asked my Lord not to divide us into warring factions and He did not grant me that",
