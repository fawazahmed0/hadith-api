I heard Abu Hurairah narrate from the Messenger of Allah a Hadith which, if that is the case, we are all doomed. She said: 'What is that?' He said: 'The Messenger of Allah said: Whoever loves to meet him, and whoever hates to meet Allah, Allah hates to meet him. But there is no one among us who does not hate death.' She said: 'The Messenger of Allah did say that, but it is not what you think. When the eyes begin to stare, the death rattle sounds in the chest and the flesh shiver, at that point, whoever loves to meet Allah, Allah loves to meet him, and whoever hates to meet Allah, Allah hates to meet him",
