He called out to him and he did not respond, so the Messenger of Allah said: \"Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return,\" and said: \"We wanted you to live but we were overtaken by the decree of Allah, O Abu Ar-Rabi.\" The women screamed and wept, and Ibn \"Atik started telling them to quiet. The Messenger of Allah said: \"Leave them; when the inevitable comes, no one should weep.\" They said: \"What is the inevitable, O Messenger of Allah?\" He said: \"Death.\" His daughter said: \"I had hoped that you would become a martyr, for you had prepared yourself for it.\" The Messenger of Allah said: \"Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, has rewarded him according to his intention. What do you think martyrdom is?\" They said: \"Being killed for the sake of Allah.\" The Messenger of Allah said: \"Martyrdom is of seven types besides being killed for the sake of Allah. The one who dies of the plague is a martyr; the one who is crushed by a falling building is a martyr; the one who is crusheds by a falling building is a martyr; the one who dies of pleurisy is a martyr; the one who dies of pleurisy is a martyr; the one who is burned to death is a martyr, and the woman who dies in pregnancy is a martyr",
