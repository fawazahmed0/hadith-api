I sat in front of 'Abdullah bin 'Umar and Ibn 'Abbas, and the women wept. Ibn 'Umar said: 'Why don't you tell them not to weep? For I heard the Messenger of Allah say: The deceased is punished due to some of his family's weeping for him.\"' Ibn 'Abbas said: \"Umar used to narrate something like that. I went out with 'Umar and when we got to on uninhabited area, he saw a caravan beneath a tree. He said: 'See whose caravan this is.' I went and I found Suhaib and his family. I came back to him and said: 'O Commander of the Believers! This is Suhaib and his family.' He said: 'Bring Suhaib to me.' When we entered Al-Madinah, 'Umar was attacked and Suhaib sat by him, weeping and saying, 'O my brother, O my brother.' 'Umar said: 'O Suhaib, do not weep, for I heard the Messenger of Allah say: The deceased is punished due to some of the weeping of his family for him. He said: I mentioned that to 'Aishah and she said: 'By Allah you are not narrating this Hadith from two liars who have disbelieved, but sometimes you mishear. And no bearer of burdens shall bear another's burden. And the Messenger of Allah said: 'Allah increases the punishment of the disbeliever because of his family's weeping for him",
