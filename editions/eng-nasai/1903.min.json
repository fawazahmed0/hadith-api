Some of us died without enjoying anything of his reward (in this world) among them is Mus'ab bin Umair. He was matyred on the day of Uhud and we could not find anything to shroud him in except a Namirah; if we covered his head with it, his feet were uncovered, and if we covered his feet with it, his head became uncovered. The Messenger of Allah told us to cover his head with it and to put Idhkhir over his feet. And for some of us, the fruits of our labor have ripened and we are gathering them.\" This is the wording of Isma'il","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":86}}]}
