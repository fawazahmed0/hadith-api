			"text": "It was narrated from Shaddad bin Al-Had that:a man from among the Bedouins came to the Prophet and believed in him and followed him, then he said: \"I will emigrate with you.\" The Prophet told one of his Companions to look after him. During one battle the Prophet got some prisoners as spoils of war, and he distributed them, giving him (that Bedouin) a share. His Companions gave him what had been allocated to him. He had been looking after some livestock for them, and when he came they gave him his share. He said: \"What is this?\" They said: \"A share that the Prophet has allocated to you.\" He took it and brought it to the Prophet and said: \"What is this?\" He said: \"I allocated it to your.\" He said: \"It is not for this that I follwed you. Rather I followed you so that I might be shot her - and he pointed to his throat - with an arrow and die and enter Paradise.\" He said: \"If you are sincere toward Allah, Allah will fulfill your wish.\" Shortly after that they got up to fight the enemy, then he was brought to the Prophet; he had pointed to. The Prophet said: \"Is it him?\" They said: \"yes.\" He said: \"He was sincere toward Allah and Allah fulfilled his wish.\" Then the Prophet shrouded him in his own cloak and out him in front of him and offered the (funeral) prayer for him. During his supplication he said: \"O allah, this is Your sloave who went out as a emigrant (Muhajir) for your sake and was killed as a martyr; I am a witness to that.: (Sahih)",
