He admitted it again, and he turned away from him. He admitted it again, and he turned away from him. Then when he had testified against himself four times, the Prophet said: \"Are your crazy?\" He said: \"No.\" He said: \"Have you been marred?\" he said: \"Yes.\" So the Prophet ordered that he be stoned. When the stones struck him, he ran away, but they caught up with him and stoned him and he died. Then the Prophet spoke well of him but he did not pray for him. (Shih)",
