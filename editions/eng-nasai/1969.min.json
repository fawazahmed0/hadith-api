He said: 'If she dies, do not bury her until I have offered the funeral prayer for her. She died and they brought her to Al-Madinah after dark, and they found that the Messenger of Allah had gone to sleep. They did not like to wake him up, so they offered the funeral prayer for her and buried her in Baqi' Al-Gharqab. The next morning they came and the Messenger of Allah asked them about her. They said: 'She has been buried, O Messenger of Allah. We came to you and found you sleeping, and we did not like to wake you up.' He said: 'let's go.' He set out walking and they went with him and showed him her grave. The Messenger of Allah stood and they formed rows behind him, and he offered the funeral prayer for her, saying the Takbir four times","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":152}}]}
