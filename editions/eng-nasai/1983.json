Wa abdilhu daran khairan min darihi wa ahlan khayran min ahlihi, wa zawjan khayran min zawjihi, wa qihi 'adhab al-qabri wa 'adhab an-nar (O Allah, forgive him and have mercy on him, forgive him and keep him safe and sound, honor the place where he settles and make his entrance wide; wash him with water and snow and hail, and cleanse him of his sin as a white garment is cleansed of dirt. Give him a house better than his house and a family better than his family and a spouse better than his spouse. Protect him from the torment of the grave and the torment of Hell-fire).\" 'Awf said: \"I wished that I was that deceased person because of the supplication that the Messenger of Allah said for that deceased person",
