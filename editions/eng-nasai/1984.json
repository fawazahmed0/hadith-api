Wa abdilhu daran khairan min darihi, wa ahlan khayran min ahlihi, wa zawjan khayran min zawjihi. Wa adkhilahul-jannah wa najjihi min an-nar\" (O Allah, forgive him and have mercy on him, keep him safe and sound and forgive him, honor the place where he settles and make his entrance wide; wash him with water and snow and hail, and cleanse him of his sin as you cleanse a white garment of dirt. O Allah, give him a house better than his house and a family better than his family and a wife better than his wife, and admit him to Paradise and save him from Hellfire).\" Or he said: \"Wa a'idhhu min 'adhab al-qabr (And protect him from the torment of the grave)",
