But I did not believe them, and I did not believe them, and I did not want to believe them. They left and the Messenger of Allah entered upon me, and I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, two of the old Jewish women of Al-Madinah said that the people of the graves are tormented in their graves.' He said: 'They spoke the truth. They are tormented in a manner that all the animals can hear.' And I never saw him offer any Salah but he sought refuge with Allah from the torment of the grave",
