As for his denying Me, It is his saying that I will not resurrect him as I created him in the beginning, but resurrecting him is not more difficult for Me than creating him in the first place. And as for his reviling Me, it is his saying that Allah has taken a son, but I am Allah, the One, the Self-Sufficient Master, I beget not nor was I begotten, and there is none co-equal or comparable unto Me",
