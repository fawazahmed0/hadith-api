So I brought him some dates and a vessel of water. That was after the Adhan of Bilal. He said: 'O Anas, find a man to come and eat with me.' So I called Zaid bin Thabit, who came and said: \"I drank some Sawiq and I want to fast.' The Messenger of Allah said: \"I also want to fast.' So he ate Sahr with him, then he got up and prayed two Rak'ahs, then he went out to the prayer",
