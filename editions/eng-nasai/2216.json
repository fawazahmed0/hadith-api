			"text": "Abu Hurairah said:\"The Messenger of Allah said: '(Allah says) Every deed of the son of Adam is for him, except fasting; it is for me and I shall reward for it. Fasting is a shield. If any one of you is fasting, let him no utter obscene talk or raise his voice in anger, and if anyone insults him or wants to fight, let him say: I am fasting. By the One in whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, the smell coming from the mouth of the fasting person is better before Allah than the fragrance of musk. The fasting person has two moments of joy: When he breaks his fast he rejoices at breaking his fast and when he meets his Lord, the Mighty and Sublime, he will rejoice at having fasted",
