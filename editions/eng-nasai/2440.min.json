When he saw me coming he said: 'They are the losers, by the Lord of the Ka'bah!' I said: 'what's happening? Perhaps something has been revealed concerning me.' I said: 'Who are they, may my father said mother be ransomed for you?'

Then he said: 'By the One in Whose hand is my soul, no man dies leaving camels, or cattle, or sheep on which he did not pay the Zakah, but they will come on the Day of Resurrection as big and fat as they ever were, trampling him with their hooves and goring him with their horns.
