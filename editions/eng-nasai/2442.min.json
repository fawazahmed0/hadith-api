Any man who has cattle and does not pay what is due on them in drought or in plenty, they will come on the Day of Resurrection as energetic, fat and lively as they ever were. He will be laid face down in a flat arena for them, and they will trample him with their cloven hooves. When the last of them has passed the first of them will return, on a day that is as long as fifty thousand years, until judgment is passed among the people and he realizes his end. Any man who has sheep and does not pay what is due on them in drought or in plenty, they will come on the Day or Resurrection as energetic, fat and lively as they ever were. He will be laid face down in a flat arena for them and they will trample him with their cloven hooves, and each horned one will gore him with its horn, and there will be none among them with twisted or broken horns.
