News of that reached the Messenger of Allah and he said: 'Do you have any property besides him?' He said: 'No.' The Messenger of Allah said: 'Who will buy him from me?' Nu'aim bin 'Abdullah Al-Adawi bought him for eight hundred Dirhams. The Messenger of Allah brought it (the money) and gave it to him, then he said: 'Start with yourself and if there is anything left, give it to our family. If there is anything left after your family (has been taken care of), then give it to your relatives. If there is anything left after your relatives (have been taken care of), then (give it) to such and such, saying: 'In front of you and to your right and to your left.\"' (Shih)",
