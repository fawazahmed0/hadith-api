He said: 'Hold on, o Qubaisah! When we get some charity we will give you some.' Then the Messenger of Allah said: 'O Qubaisah, charity is not permissible except for one of three: A man who undertakes a financial responsibility, so it is permissible for him to be given charity until he finds means to make him independent and to suffice him; a man who was stricken by calamity and his wealth was destroyed, so it is permissible for him to ask for help until he has enough to keep him going, them he should refrain from asking; and a man who is stricken with poverty and three wise men from among his own people testily that so-and-so is in desperate need, then it is permissible for him to ask for help until he finds means to make him independent and to suffice him. Asking for help in cases other than these, O Qubaisah, is unlawful, and the one who takes it is consuming it unlawfully","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":23,"hadith":146}}]}
