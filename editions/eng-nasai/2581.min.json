He said: 'What I fear most for you after I am gone is the (worldly) delights that will come to you.' And he spoke of this world and its attractions. A man said: 'Can good bring forth evil? 'The Messenger of Allah remained silent and it was said to him (that man): 'What is the matter with you? You speak to the Messenger of Allah when he does not speak to you?
