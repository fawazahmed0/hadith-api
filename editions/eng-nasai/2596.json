' So I went to the Messenger of Allah and found a man with him asking him (for something), and the Messenger of Allah was saying: 'I do not have anything to give to you.' The man turned away angrily, saying: 'You only give to those you want. 'The Messenger of Allah said: 'He is angry with me because I did not have anything to give him. Whoever asks of you and he has an Uqiyah or its equivalent, then he has been too demanding in asking.\"' Al-Asadi said: I said: 'Our milch-camel is worth more than an Uqiyah, 'and an Uqiyah is forty Dirhams. \"So I went back and did not ask him for anything. Then the Messenger of Allah got some barley and raisins after that, and he gave us a share of them, until Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, made us independent of means",
