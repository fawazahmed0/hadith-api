He remained silent until he had repeated it three times. Then he said: 'If I said yes, it would be obligatory, and if it were obligatory you would not be able to do it. Leave me alone so long as I have left you alone. Those who came before you were destroyed because they asked too many questions and differed with their prophets. If I command you to do something then follow it as much as you can, and if I forbid you to do something then avoid it",
