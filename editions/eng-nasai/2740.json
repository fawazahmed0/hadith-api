He told us: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stayed in al-Madinah for nine years of Hajj, then it was announced to the people that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was going to perform Hajj this year. Many people came to al-Madinah, all of them hoping to learn from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and to do as he did. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) set out when there were five days left of Dhul-Qa`dah, and we set out with him,: Jabir said; \"And the Messenger of Allah was among us; the Qur'an was being revealed to him, and he knew what it meant. Whatever he did based on it (the Qur'an), we did, and we set out with no intention other than Hajj",
