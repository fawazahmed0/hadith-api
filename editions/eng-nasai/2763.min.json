Then, whe we were in Sarif her menses started. When we came, we circumambulated the Ka'bah and (performed Sa'i) between As-safa and Al-Marwah. Then, the Messenger of Allah commanded those of us who did not have a Hadi to exit Ihram. We said: 'Exit Ihram to what degree?' He said\" 'Completely.' So we had intercourse with out, wives put on perfume, and wore only four nights away from 'Arafat. The, we entered Ihram on the day of At-Tarwiyah. The Messenger of Allah entered upon 'Aishah and found here weeping. He said: 'What is the matter with you?' She said: 'I have got my menses and the people exited Ihram, but I did not exit Ihram or did I circumambulate the House, and the people are going for Hajj now.' He said: 'This is something that Allah ahs decreed for the daughters of Adam. Perform Ghusl, then begin the Talbiyah for Hajj.' So she did that and did all the rituals. Then, when she became pure, she circumambulated the House and (Performed Sa'i) between As-Safa and Al-Marwah. Then, he said: 'You have exited Ihram from your Hajj and your 'Umrah at the same time.\" She said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I feel upset because I only circumambulated the House during my Hajj.' He said: 'Take here, O 'Abdullah, to perform 'Umrah from At-Tan'im.' And that was on the night of Al-Hasbah (the twelfth night of Dhul-Hijjah)","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":24,"hadith":145}}]}
