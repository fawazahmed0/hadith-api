(He said:) 'While I was with my companions, some of them laughed at others. I looked and saw an onager. I stabbed it then asked them to help, but they refused to help me. We ate from its meat, and we were afraid that we would be intercepted (by the enemy) so I followed the Messenger of Allah, sometimes making my horse gallop and sometimes traveling at a regular place. I met a man from Ghifar at midnight and said: Where did you leave the Messenger of Allah? He said: I left him when he was napping in As-Suqya. I caught up with him and said: O messenger of Allah! Your Companions convey their greetings of Salam to you, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings. They were afraid that they may be intercepted and cut off from you, so wait for them. Then I said: O Messenger of Allah, I caught an onager and I have some of it. He said to the People: Eat, and they were I Ihram","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":24,"hadith":207}}]}
