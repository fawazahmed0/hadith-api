I would have made its (door) in level with the ground and I would have given it two doors, an eastern door and a western door. For they built it too small, and by doing this, it would have been built on the foundation of Ibrahim, peace be upon him.\" He (one of the narrators said: \"This is what motivated Ibn Az-Zubair to knock it down.\" Yazid said: \"I saw Ibn Az-Zubair when he knocked it down and rebuilt it, and included part of the Hijr in it. And I saw the foundation of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, stones like the humps of camels joined to one another)",
