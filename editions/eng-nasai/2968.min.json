Aishah said: 'What a bad thing you said, O son of my brother! If this Ayah was as you have interpreted it, there would be no sin on a person if he did not go between them. But it was revealed concering the Ansar. Before they accepted Islam, they sued to enter Ihram for the false goddess Manat whom they used to worship at Al-Mushallal. Whoever enter Ihram for her would refrain from going between As-Safa and Al-Marwah. When they asked the Messenger of Allah about that, Allah, the Might and Sublime, revealed: 'Verily As-Safa and Al-Marwah (Two mountains in Makkah) are of the Symbols of Allah. So it is not a sin on him who performs Hajj or Urmrah (Pilgrimage) of the House (the Kabah at Makkah) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them (As-Safa and Al-Marwah). Then the Messenger of Allah enjoined going between them so no one has the right to refrain from going between them","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":24,"hadith":351}}]}
