We were distressed and upset by that. News of that reached the Messenger of Allah and he said: 'O people, exit Ihram. Were if not for the Hadi that I brought with me, I would have done what you are doing.' So we exited Ihram, and had intercourse with our wives, ad we did everything that the non-Muhrim does until the day of At-Tarwiyah, when we put Makkah behind us (When we headed for Mina) and entered Ihram for Hajj",
