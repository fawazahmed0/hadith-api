We were respected when we were idolaters and when we believed, we were humiliated.” He said: “I have been commanded to pardon, so do not fight.” Then, when Allah caused us to move to Al-Madinah, He commanded us to fight, but they refrained. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: Have you not seen those who were told to hold back their hands (from fighting) and perform As-Salah”",
