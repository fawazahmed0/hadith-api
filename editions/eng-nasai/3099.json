He told us that Zaid bin Thabit told him, that the following was revealed to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ): (Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home) and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah), then Ibn Umm Maktum came when he was dictating it to me (Zaid), and said: 'O Messenger of Allah! If I were able to go for Jihad I would go out for Jihad.' Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed to him - while his thigh was against mine, and became so heavy that I thought my thigh would break, until (the revelation) stopped -: 'Except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame).'\" [1] Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasa'i) said: This 'Abdur-Rahman bin Ishaq is tolerable, while 'Abdur-Rahman bin IShaq, from whom reports 'Ali bin Mushir, abu Mu'awiyah, and 'Abdul-Wahid bin Ziyad from An-Nu'man bin Sa'd - he is not trustworthy.
