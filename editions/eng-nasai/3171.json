Umm Haram was married to 'Ubadah bint As-Samit. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ entered upon her and she fed him and checked his head for lice. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) fell asleep, then he woke up smiling. She said: 'What is making you smile, O Messenger of Allah?' He said: 'Some people of my Ummah were shown to me, fighting in the cause of Allah and riding across the sea like kings on thrones.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah to make me one of them.' So the Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah to make me one of them.' So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed for her then he slept again.'\" (One of narrators) Al-Harith, said (in his narration): \"He slept then he woke up smiling. I said to him: 'What is making you smile, O Messenger of Allah?' He said: 'Some people of my Ummah were shown to me, fighting in the cause of Allah and riding across the sea like kings on thrones,' as he had said the first time.
