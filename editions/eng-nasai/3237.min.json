And the Messenger of Allah proposed that I marry his freed slave, Usamah bin Zaid. I was told that the Messenger of Allah had said: 'Whoever loves me, let him love Usamah.' When the Messenger of Allah spoke to me I said: 'My affairs are in your hands; marry me to whomever you wish.' He said: 'Go to Umm Sharik.' Umm Sharik was a rich Ansari woman who used to spend a great deal in the cause of Allah, and she always had a lot of guests. I said: 'I will do that.' He said: 'Do not do that, for Umm Sharik has a lot of guests, and I would not like your Khimar to fall off, or your shins to become uncovered, and the people to see something of you that you do not want them to see. Rather go to your cousin (son of your paternal uncle) 'Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Umm Maktum, who is a man of Banu Fihr.' So I went to him","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":26,"hadith":42}}]}
