She said: 'His Companions used to go to her.' Then he said: 'Observe your 'Iddah in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum, who is blind, and when your 'Iddah is over, let me know.'\" She said: \"When my 'Iddah was over, I let him know. The Messenger of Allah said: 'Who has proposed marriage to you?' I said: 'Mu'awiyah and another man from the Quraish.' He said: 'As for Mu'awiyah, he is a boy among the Quraish and does not have anything, and as for the other he is a bad man with no goodness in him.
