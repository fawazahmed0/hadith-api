He was one of the Companions of the Prophet, and he died in Al-Madinah.\" Umar said: \"I went to 'Uthman bin 'Affan and offered Hafsah in marriage to him. I said: 'If you wish, I will marry you to Hafsah bint 'Umar.' He said: 'I will think about it.' A few days passed, then I met him and he said: 'It seems that I do not want to get married at the moment.'\" 'Umar said: \"Then I met Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, and said: 'If you wish, I will marry Hafsah bint 'Umar to you.' Abu Bakr remained silent, and did not give me any answer, and I felt more upset with him than I had with 'Uthman. Several days passed, then the Messenger of Allah proposed marriage to her and I married her to him. Abu Bakr met me and said: 'Perhaps you felt upset with me when you offered Hafsah in marriage to me, and I did not give you any answer?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Nothing prevented me from giving you an answer when you made the offer to me, except the fact that I had heard the Messenger of Allah speak of her, and I did not want to disclose the secret of the Messenger of Allah. If he had left her, then I would have married her","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":26,"hadith":64}}]}
