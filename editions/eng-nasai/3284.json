I said: 'Yes; I do not have you all to myself and I would like to share this goodness with my sister.' The Prophet said: 'Your sister is not permissible for me (to marry).' I said: 'By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, we have been saying that you want to marry Durrah bint Abi Salamah.' He said: 'The daughter of Umm Salamah?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'By Allah, even if she were not my stepdaughter who is in my care, she would not be permissible for me (to marry), because she is the daughter of my brother through breast-feeding. Thuwaibah breastfed Abu Salamah and I. So do not offer your daughters or sisters to me in marriage",
