Then the Prophet rode and Abu Talha rode, and I was riding behind Abu Talha. The Prophet of Allah passed through the lane of Khaibar quickly, and my knee was touching the thigh of the Messenger of Allah, and I could see the whiteness of the thigh of the Prophet. When he entered the town he said: 'Allahu Akbar, Khaibar is destroyed! Whenever we approach a (hostile) nation to fight, evil will be the morning for those who have been warned.' He said this three times. The people came out for their work.\" (One of the narrators) 'Abdul-'Aziz said: \"They said: 'Muhammad (has come)!'\" 'Abdul-'Aziz said: \"Some of our companions said: 'With his army.'\" \"We conquered Khaibar and gathered the captives. Dihyah came and said: 'O Prophet of Allah, give me a slave girl from among the captives.' He said: 'Go and take a slave girl.' He took Safiyyah bint Huyayy. Then a man came to the Prophet and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, you gave Dihyah Safiyyah bint Huyayy, and she is the chief mistress of Quraizah and An-Nadir, and she is fit for no one but you.' He said: 'Call him to bring her.' When the Prophet saw her, he said: 'Take any other slave girl from among the captives.'\" He said: \"The Prophet of Allah set her free and married her.\" (One of the narrators) Thabit said to him: \"O Abu Hamzah, what dowry did he give her?\" He (Anas) said: \"Herself; he set her free and married her.\" He said: \"While on the road, Umm Sulaim fitted her out and presented her to him in the night, and the following morning he was a bridegroom. He said: 'Whoever has anything, let him bring it.' He spread out a leather cloth and men came with cottage cheese, dates, and ghee, and they made Hais, and that was the Walimah (wedding feast) of the Messenger of Allah","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":26,"hadith":185}}]}
