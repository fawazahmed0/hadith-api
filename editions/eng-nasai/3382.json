			"text": "It was narrated that Anas said:\"The Prophet stayed between Khaibar and Al-Madinah for three days when he consummated his marriage to Safiyyah bint Huyayy, and I invited the Muslims to his Walimah, in which there was no bread or meat. He commanded that a leather cloth (be spread) and dates, cottage cheese and ghee were placed on it, and that was his Walimah. The Muslims said: '(Will she be) one of the Mothers of the Believers, or a female slave whom his right hand possesses?' They said: 'If he has a Hijab for her, then she will be one of the Mothers of the Believers and if she does not have a Hijab then she will be a female slave whom his right hand possesses.' When he rode on, he set aside a plate for her behind him and extended a Hijab between her and the people",
