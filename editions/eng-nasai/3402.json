			"text": "Sahl bin Sa'd As-Sa'idi narrated that 'Uwaimir Al-'Ajlani came to 'Asim bin 'Adiy and said:\"What do you think, O 'Asim! If a man finds another man with his wife, should he kill him, and be killed in retaliation, or what should he do? O 'Asim! Ask the Messenger of Allah about that for me.\" So 'Asim asked the Messenger of Allah about that, and the Messenger of Allah disapproved of the question, and criticized the asking of too many questions until 'Asim felt upset. When 'Asim went back to his people, 'Uwaimir came to him and said: \"O 'Asim, what did the Messenger of Allah say to you?\" 'Asim said: \"You have not brought me any good. The Messenger of Allah disapproved of the question you asked.\" 'Uwaimir said: \"By Allah, I will go and ask the Messenger of Allah.\" So he went to the Messenger of Allah and found him in the midst of the people. He said: \"O Messenger of Allah, what do you think if a man finds another man with his wife -should he kill him, and be killed in retaliation or what should he do?\" The Messenger of Allah said: \"Something has been revealed concerning you and your wife, so go and bring her here.\" Sahl said: \"So they engaged in the procedure of Li'an, and I was among the people in the presence of the Messenger of Allah. When 'Uwaimir finished he said: \"I would have been telling lies about her, O Messenger of Allah, if I keep her.\" So he divorced her thrice before the Messenger of Allah told him to do so",
