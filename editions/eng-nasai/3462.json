The Messenger of Allah went out to pray As-Subh and he found Habibah bint Sahl at his door at the end of the night. The Messenger of Allah said: 'Who is this?' She said: 'I am Habibah bint Sahl, O Messenger of Allah.' He said: 'What is the matter?' She said: 'I cannot live with Thabit bin Qais' -her husband. When Thabit bin Qais came, the Messenger of Allah said to him: 'Here is Habibah bint Sahl and she has said what Allah willed she should say.' Habibah said: 'O Messenger of Allah, everything that he gave me is with me.' The Messenger of Allah said: 'Take it from her.' So he took it from her and she stayed with her family",
