He came to the Prophet and told him about that. The Prophet said: '(Bring) four witnesses, otherwise (you will feel) the Hadd punishment on your back.' And he repeated that several times. Hilal said to him: 'By Allah, O Messenger of Allah! Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, knows that I am telling the truth, and Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, will certainly reveal to you that which will spare my back from the whip.' While they were like that, the Verse of Li'an was revealed to him: 'As to those who accuse their wives.' He called Hilal and he bore witness four times by Allah that he was telling the truth, and the fifth time he invoked the curse of Allah upon him if he were lying. Then he called the woman and she bore witness four times by Allah that he was lying. When it came to the fourth or fifth time, the Messenger of Allah said: 'Stop her, for it will inevitably bring the punishment of Allah upon the liar.' She hesitated until we thought that she was going to confess, then she said: 'I will not dishonor my people today.' Then she went ahead with the oath. The Messenger of Allah said: 'Wait and see. If she produces a child who is white, with straight hair and Qadiy'a eyes, then he belongs to Hilal bin Umayyah, but if she produces a child who is dark with curly hair, of average size and with narrow calves, then he belongs to Sharik bin As-Sahma'.' She produced a child who was dark with curly hair, of average size and with narrow calves. The Messenger of Allah said: 'Had not the matter been settled by the Book of Allah, I would have punished her severely","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih Isnaad"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih Isnaad"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":27,"hadith":81}}]}
