He asked two of them: 'Do you affirm that this child belongs to (the third man)?' And they said: 'No.' He asked another two of them: 'Do you affirm that this child belongs to (the third man)?' And they said: 'No.' So he cast lots between them, and attributed the child to the one whom the lot fell, and obliged him to pay two-thirds of the Diyah.
