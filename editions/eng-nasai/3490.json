A man came to him and said: 'I saw 'Ali when three men were brought to him who all claimed (to be the father) of a child. 'Ali said to one of them: Will you give the child up to him? And he refused. He said to (the next one): Will you give the child up to him? And he refused. He said to (the next one): Will you give the child up to him? And he refused. 'Ali said: You are disputing partners. I will cast lots among you, and whoever wins the draw, the child is for him, and he has to pay two-thirds of the Diyah.' The Messenger of Allah laughed so much that his back teeth became visible",
