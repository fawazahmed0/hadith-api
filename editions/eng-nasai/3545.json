			"text": "Abdur-Rahman bin 'Asim narrated that Fatimah bint Qais -who was married to a man of Banu Makhzum- told him that he divorced her three times. He went out on a military campaign and told his representative to give her some provision. She thought it was too little, so she went to one of the wives of the Prophet, and the Messenger of Allah came in while she was with her. She said:\"O Messenger of Allah, this is Fatimah bint Qais who has been divorced by so-and-so. He sent her some provision but she rejected it. He said that it was something he did not have to do (a favor).\" He said: \"He is telling the truth.\" The Prophet said: \"Go to Umm Kulthum and observe your 'Iddah in her house.\" Then he said: \"Umm Kulthum is a woman who has a lot of visitors. Go to 'Abdullah bin Umm Maktum for he is blind.\" So she went to 'Abdullah and observed her 'Iddah in his house, until her 'Iddah was over. Then Abu Al-Jahm and Mu'awiyah bin Abi Sufyan proposed to her. So she came to the Messenger of Allah to consult him about them. He said: \"As for Abu Al-Jahm, he is a man the waving of whose stick I fear for you. And as for Mu'awiyah he is a man who does not have any money.\" So she married Usamah bin Zaid after that",
