I came to the Messenger of Allah and said: 'I have acquired some land and I have never acquired any wealth that is dearer to me or more precious than it.' He said: 'If you wish, you can give it in charity.'\" So he gave it in charity on condition that it would not be bought or given away, for the poor, relatives, slaves, guests and wayfarers. And there is no sin on the administrator if he eats from it or feeds others on a reasonable basis, with no intention of becoming wealthy from it",
