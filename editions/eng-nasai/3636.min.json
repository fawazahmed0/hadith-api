When the time to pick the dates came, I went to the Messenger of Allah and said:\"You know that my father was martyred on the Day of Uhud and he left behind a great deal of debt. I would like the creditors to see you.\" He said: \"Go and pile up the dates in separate heaps.\" I did that, then I called him. When they saw him, it was as if they started to put pressure on me at that time. When he saw what they were doing, he went around the biggest heap three times, then he sat on it then said: \"Call your companions (the creditors).\" Then he kept on weighing them out for them, until Allah cleared all my father's debts. I am pleased that Allah cleared my father's debts without even a single date being missed","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":30,"hadith":26}}]}
