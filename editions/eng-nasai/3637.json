My father has died owing debts, and he has not left anything but what his date-palms produce. What his date-palms produce will not pay off his debts for years. Come with me, O Messenger of Allah, so that the creditors will not be harsh with me.' The Messenger of Allah went to each heap, saying Salams and supplicating for it, then sitting on it. He called the creditors and paid them off, and what was left was as much as what they had taken",
