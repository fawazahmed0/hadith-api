I asked the Messenger of Allah to intercede with his creditors so that they would waive part of the debt. He asked them to do that but they refused. The Prophet said to me: 'Go and sort your dates into their different kinds: The 'Ajwah on one side, the cluster of Ibn Zaid on another side, and so on. Then send for me.' I did that, then the Messenger of Allah came and sat at the head or in the middle of the heaps. Then he said: 'Measure them out for the people.' So I measured them out for them until I had paid them all off, and my dates were left as if nothing had been taken from them","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":30,"hadith":28}}]}
