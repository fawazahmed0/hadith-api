This caused hardship to the Muslims, so Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: \"And they ask you concerning orphans. Say: The best thing is to work honestly in their property, and if you mix your affairs with theirs, then they are your brothers\" (in religion), so it is permissible for you to mix with them",
