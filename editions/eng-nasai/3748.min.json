He said: 'I have given it to you and to your descendants so long as any of you are still alive.' So it belongs to the one to whom it was given, and it cannot revert to the first owner, since he has given it as a gift, and as such, it becomes subject to the same ruling as the estate","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":34,"hadith":30}}]}
