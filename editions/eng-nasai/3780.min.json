He said: 'By Allah, I cannot give you anything to ride and I have nothing to give you to ride.' We stayed as long as Allah willed, then some camels were brought to him. He ordered that we be given three fine-looking camels. When we left, we said to one another: 'We came to the Messenger of Allah to ask him for animals to ride, and he swore by Allah that he would not give us anything to ride, then he gave us something.'\" Abu Musa said: \"We came to the Prophet and told him about that. He said: 'I did not give you animals to ride, rather Allah gave you them to ride.
