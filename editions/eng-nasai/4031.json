			"text": "It was narrated that Anas said:\"Some people from 'Uraynah became Muslim, but the climate of Al-Madinah did not suit them. The Messenger of Allah [SAW] said to them: 'Why don't you go out to some camels of ours and drink their milk?'\" - (one of the narrators) Humaid said: \"And Qatadah said, narrating from Anas: 'And their urine.'\" - \"So they did that, and when they recovered they reverted to disbelief after their Islam, killed the herdsman of the Messenger of Allah [SAW], who was a believer, drove off the camels of the Messenger of Allah [SAW], and fled as those at war. The Messenger of Allah [SAW] sent someone to bring them and they were caught. He had their hands and feet cut off and their eyes branded, then he left them in Al-Harrah until they died",
