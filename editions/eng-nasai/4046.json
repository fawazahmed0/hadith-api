Whoever among them repents before he is captured, you have no way against him. This Verse does not apply to the Muslims. Whoever kills, spreads mischief in the land, and wages war against Allah and His Messenger, then joins the disbelievers before he can be caught, there is nothing to prevent the Hadd punishment being carried out on him because of what he did",
