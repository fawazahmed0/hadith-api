Then Jibra'il, peace be upon him, came to him and said: 'A Jewish man has put a spell on you. In such and such a well there is a knot that he tied for you.' The Messenger of Allah [SAW] sent them to take it out and bring it to him. Then the Messenger of Allah [SAW] got up as if he had been released from some bonds. No mention of that was made to that Jew, and he did not see that in his face at all",
