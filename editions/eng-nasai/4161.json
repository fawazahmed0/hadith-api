Whoever fulfills (this pledge), his reward will be with Allah, and whoever commits any of these actions and is punished for it, it will be an expiation for him. Whoever commits any of these actions then Allah conceals him, then his affair is up to Allah; if He wills He will forgive him, and if He wills punish him.\"' (Sahih) Ahmed bin Sa'eed contradicted him",
