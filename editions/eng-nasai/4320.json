I took a mastigure and grilled it, and brought it to the Prophet. He took a palm stalk, and started counting his fingers with it, and said: 'A nation from among the children of Israel was turned into beasts of the Earth, and I do not know what kind of animals they were, I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, the people have eaten some of them.' He did not tell them to eat it, and he did not forbid them from eating it",
