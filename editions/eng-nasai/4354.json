He supplied us with a sack of dates and gave them out by the handful. When he ran short, he gave us one date at a time, until we used to suck on it like an infant, and we would drink water with it. When we ran out of them it became very difficult for us. We used to hit the Khabat leaves with our bows to knock them down) and swallow them, then drink water with it. We became known as Jaish Al-Khabat (the Khabat army). Then, when we were about to turn inland, we saw a beast like a hill, caloled Al-'Anbar. Abu 'Ubaidah said: 'It is dead meat, do not eat it.' Then he said: 'The army of the Messenger of Allah in the cause of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and we are forced by necessity; eat in the name of Allah. 'So we arte from it and we made some if it into jerked meat. Thirteen men could sit in its eye-socket. Abu Ubaidah took one of its ribs and seated a man on the biggest camel that the people had, and they passed beneath it. When we came to the Messenger of Allah, he said: 'What kept you so long?' We said: The Quraish' and we told him about the beast. He said: 'That is provision that Allah granted to you. Do you have anything of it with you? \"We said: ' Yes",
