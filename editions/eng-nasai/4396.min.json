A man stood up and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, this is a day when people want to eat meat.' He mentioned that his neighbors were poor and it was as if the Messenger of Allah believed him. He said: 'I have a Jadh'ah that is dearer to me than tow sheep for meat.; So he granted him a concession (allowing him to sacrifice it) but I do not know whether it applied to anyone else or not.
