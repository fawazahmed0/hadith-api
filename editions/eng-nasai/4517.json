And he said that Mulamasah means when one man says to another: \"I will sell you my garment for your garment,\" and neither of them looks at the garment of the others, rather he just touches it. And Munabadhah is when he says: \"I will throw what I have and you throw what you have,\" so that they buy from one another, and neither of them knows how much the other has, and so on",
