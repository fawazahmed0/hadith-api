I thought I wanted to let it go, but the Messenger of \"Allah met me and prayed for it (the camel) and hit it. Then it started to run like never before. He said: 'Sell it to me for one Uwqyah.' I said\" 'No.' He said: 'Sell it to me.' So I sold it to him for one Uwqiyah but stipulated an exception, to ride it until we reached al-Madinah. When we reached Al-Medina, I brought the camel to him and asked him for its price, then I went back. He sent word to me saying; 'Do you think I bargained with you to take your camel?' Take your camel and your Dirhams",
