			"text": "It was narrated that Jabir 'Abdullah said:\"I was with the Messenger of Allah on a journey, and I was riding a camel. He said: 'Why are you at the back of the people?, I said: 'My camel is tired, He took hold of its tail and shouted at it, then I was at the front of the people, worrying that it would go ahead of the others. When we drew close to al-Madinah he said: 'What happened to the camel? Sell it to me.' I said, No, it is yours O Messenger of Allah.; He said, 'No, sell it tome. I said, 'No, it is yours, O Messenger of Allah.' He said: 'No, sell it to me. I will take it for one Uwqiyah but you (continue to) ride it. Then when you reach Al-Madinah, bring it to us.' So when I reached Al-Madinah, I brought it him. He said to Bilal: 'O Bilal, weight out for him one Uwqiyyah and add a Qirat.' I said: 'This is something extra that the Messenger of Allah gave to.' I kept it with me and put it in a bag, and it stayed with me until the people of Ash-Sham came on the Day of Al-Harrah and took from us what they took",
