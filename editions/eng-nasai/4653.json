The Messenger of Allah called for him (the slave) to be brought and he said: \"Who will buy him?\" Nu'aim bin 'Abdullah bought him for eight hundred dirhams, and he gave it to him and said: \"If one of you is poor, let him start with himself; if there is anything left over, (let him give it) to his dependents; if there is anything left over, (let him give it) to his relatives; and if there is anything left over, (let him give it) here and there",
