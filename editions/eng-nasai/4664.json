Ibn'Abbas said:\"A man gave the Messenger of Allah a skin full of wine, and the Prophet said to him;' did you know that Allah has forbidden it?' He whispered something and I did not understand what he whispered as I wanted to. I asked a person who was beside him and the Prophet said to him; 'What are you whispering about?'
