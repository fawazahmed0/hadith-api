The Messenger of Allah said: \"Will you swear fifty oaths, then you will receive compensation or be entitled to retaliate?\" They said: \"O Messenger of Allah, how can we swear an oath when we did not witness, and did not see (what happened)?\" He said: \"The n can the Jews swear fifty oaths declaring their innocence?\" They said: \"O Messenger of Allah, how can we accept the oath of a disbelieving people?\" So the Messenger of Allah paid the blood money himself",
