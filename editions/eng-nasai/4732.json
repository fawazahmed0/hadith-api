			"text": "It was narrated from Simak, from 'Ikrimah, that Ibn 'Abbas said:\"There were (the two tribes of) Quraizah and An-Nadir, and An-Nadir was nobler than Quraiaah. If a man of Quraizah Killed a man of An-Nadir, he would be killed in return, but if a man of An-Nadir killed a man of Quraizah, he would pay a Diyah of one hundred Wasqs of dates. When An-Nadir killed a man of Quraizah, and they said: 'Hand him over to us and we will kill him.' They said: 'Between us and you (as judge) is the Prophet.' So they came to him, then the following was revealed: \"And if you judge, judge with justice between them.\"[3] Al-Qisl (justice) means a soul for a soul. Then the following was revealed: \"Do they then seek the judgment of (the days of) Ignorance?\"[4]",
