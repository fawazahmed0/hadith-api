If you turn away from then up to: those who act justly.\"[1] - were revealed concerning the matter of blood money between An-Nadir and Quraizah. That was because the slain of An-Nadir were of noble status, so the blood money would be paid in full for them, but for Banu Quraizah only half of the blood money would be paid. They referred the matter to the Messenger of Allah for judgment, then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed that concerning them, so the Messenger of Allah told them to do the right thing and he made the blood money equal",
