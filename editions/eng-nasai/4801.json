			"text": "It was narrated from 'Amr bin Shu'aib, from his father, from his grandfather, that the Messenger of Allah said:\"Whoever is killed by mistake, his ransom is one hundred camels: Thirty Bint Makkah, thirty Bint Labun, thirty Hiqqah and ten Bin Labun. \"[1] The Messenger of Allah used to fix the value (of the Diayah for accidental killing) among town-dwellers at four hundred Dinars or the equivalent value in silver. When he calculated the price in terms of people with camels (for Bedouin), it would vary from one time to another. When prices rose, the value in Dinars would rise, and when prices fell the value in Dinars would fall. At the time of the Messenger of Allah the value was between four hundred and eight hundred Dinars, or the equivalent value in silver, eight thousand Dirhams. And the Messenger of Allah ruled that if a person's blood money was paid in cattle, among those who kept cattle, the amount was two hundred cows; and if a person's blood money was paid in sheep, among this who kept sheep, the value was two thousand sheep. The Messenger of Allah ruled that the blood money is part of the estate, to be divided among the heirs of the victim according to their allotted shares, and whatever is left over is for the 'Asabah. And the Messenger of Allah ruled that if a woman commits urder then he 'Asahah, whoever they may be, must pay the blood money, but they do not inherit anything except that which is left over from her heirs; if a woman is killed then her blood money is to be shared among her heirs, and they may kill her killer.
