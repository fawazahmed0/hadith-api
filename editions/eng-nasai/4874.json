They came and said: \"You let them go without any pressure (to make them admit to their crime) or beating?\" An-Nu'man said: \"What do you want? If you wish, I will beat them, and if Allah brings back your goods thereby, all well and good. Otherwise I will take retaliation from your backs (by beating you) likewise.\" They said: \"is this your ruling?\" He said: \"This is the ruling of Allah and His Messenger \"(Daif)",
