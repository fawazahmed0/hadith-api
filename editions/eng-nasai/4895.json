They said: \"Who would dare to speak to the Messenger of Allah except Usamah.\" So they spoke to Usamah and he spoke to (the Prophet). The Prophet said: \"O Usamah, the Children of Israel were destroyed because whenever a noble person among them committed a crime, for which a Hadd punishment was deserved, they would let him go. But if a low-class person among them committed such a crime, they would carry out the punishment on him. If Fatimah bint Muhammad were to steal, I would cut off her hand",
