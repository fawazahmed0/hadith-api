The face of ht Messenger of Allah changed color while he was speaking to him. Then the Messenger of Allah said to him: 'Are you interceding with me concerning one of ht Hadd punishments decreed by Allah?' Usamah said: 'Pray for forgiveness for me, O Messenger of Allah! Then the Messenger of Allah stood up that evening, he praised and glorified Allah, the mighty and sublime, as he deserves, then he said: 'The people who came before you were destroyed because, whenever a noble person among them stole, they let him go. But if a low-class person stole, they would carry out the punishment on him. By the One in whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, if Fatimah bint Muhammad were to steal, I would cut off her hand.'
