He said: 'The hand (of the thief) is not to be cut off for (stealing) fruit on the tree, but if (the fruit) has been taken to the place where it is stored to dry, then the (thief's) hand is to be cut off (if what is stolen is equivalent to) the price of a shield. The (thief's) hand is not to be cut off for a sheep (stolen) from the grazing land, but if it had been put in the pen, then the (thief's) hand is to be cut off (if what is stolen is equivalent to) the price of a shield",
