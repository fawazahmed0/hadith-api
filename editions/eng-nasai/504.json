So he prayed Zuhr when the sun had passsed its zenith, 'Asr when the shadow of a thing was equal to its height, Maghrib when the sun had set and 'Isha' when the twilight had disappeared.\" He said: \"Then he prayed Zuhr when the shadow of a man was equal in length to his height, 'Asr when the length of a man's shadow was twice his height, and Maghrib just before the twilight disappeared.\" (One of the narrators) 'Abdullah bin Al-Harith said: \"then he said: 'With regard to 'Isha' I think it is up to one-third of the night.'\" [1] [1] The speaker there is Thawr, who narrated it from 'Ata' from Jabir",
