Then he waited until a man's shadow was equal to his height. Then he came to him for 'Asr and said: 'Get up, O Muhammad, and pray 'Asr.' Then he waited until the sunset, then he came to him and said: 'Get up, O Muhammad, and pray Maghrib.' So he got up and prayed it when the sun had set. Then he waited until the twilight disappeared, then he came to him and said: 'Get up, O Muhammad, and pray 'Isha'.' So he got up and prayed it. Then he came to him when dawn broke and said: 'Get up, O Muhammad, and pray.' So he got up and prayed Subh.' So he got up and prayed Subh. Then he came to him the next day when a man's shadow was equal to his height, and said: 'Get up, O Muhammad, and pray.' So he prayed Zuhr. Then Jibril came to him when a man's shadow was equal to twice his length and said: 'Get up, O Muhammad, and pray.' So he prayed 'Asr. Then he came to him for Maghrib when the sun set, at exactly the same time as the day before, and said: 'Get up, O Muhammad, and pray.' So he prayed Maghrib. Then he came to him for 'Isha' when the first third of the night had passed, and said: 'Get up and pray.' So he prayed 'Isha'. Then he came to him for Subh when it had become very bright, and said: 'Get up and pray.' So he prayed Subh. Then he said: 'The times of prayer one between those two (limits)",
