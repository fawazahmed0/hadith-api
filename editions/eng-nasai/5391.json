Al-Fadl started looking at her, and she at him, and the Messenger of Allah [SAW] turned the face of Al-Fadl the other way. She said: 'O Messenger of Allah, the command of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, to His slaves to perform Hajj has come while my father is an old man, and he cannot sit firmly in the saddle; can I perform Hajj on his behalf?' He said: 'Yes.' That was during the Farewell Pilgrimage",
