His opponent, who was wiser than him, stood up and said: 'He is right, pass judgment between us according to the Book of Allah.' He said: 'Speak.' He said: 'My son was a laborer serving this man, and he committed Zina with his wife. I ransomed him with one hundred sheep and a servant.' It is as if he was told that his son was to be stoned to death but he ransomed him from that. 'Then I asked some knowledgeable men and they told me that my son was to be given one hundred lashes and exiled for a year.' The Messenger of Allah [SAW] said to him: 'By the One in Whose hand is my soul, I will pass judgment between you according to the Book of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. As for the one hundred sheep and the servant, take them back, and your son is to be given one hundred lashes and exiled for a year. O Unais, go tomorrow to the wife of this man and if she confesses, then stone her to death.' She did confess, so he stoned her to death","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":49,"hadith":33}}]}
