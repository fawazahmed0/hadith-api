Allahumma at nafsi taqwaha, wa zakkaha anta khairu min zakkaha, anta waliyyuha wa mawlaha.

O Allah, make my soul obedient and purify it, for You are the best One to purify it, You are its Guardian and Lord. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from a soul that is not satisfied, a heart that is not humble, knowledge that is of no benefit and a supplication that is not answered)",
