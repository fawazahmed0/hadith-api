			"text": "Abu Hamzah Nasr said:\"I said to Ibn 'Abbas that my grandmother makes Nabidh in an earthenware jar and it is sweet. If I drink a lot of it and sit with people, I am worried that they will find out. He said: 'The delegation of 'Abdul-Qais came to the Messenger of Allah [SAW] and he said: Welcome to a delegation that is not disgraced or filled with regret. They said: O Messenger of Allah, the idolators are between us and you, and we can only reach you during the sacred months. Tell us of something which, if we do it, we will enter Paradise, and we can tell it to those whom we left behind. He said: I will enjoin three things upon you, and forbid four things to you. I order you to have faith in Allah, and do you know what faith in Allah is? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: (It means) testifying that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, establishing Salah, paying Zakah and giving one-fifth (the Khums) of the spoils of war. And I forbid four things to you: That which is soaked in Ad-Dubba', An-Naqir, Al-Hantam, and Al-Muzaffat",
