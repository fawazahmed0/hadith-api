			"text": "Ibn 'Umar said:\"While he was at the Rukn, I saw a man bring a cup to the Messenger of Allah [SAW] in which there was Nabidh. He gave the cup to him and he raised it to his mouth, but he found it to be strong, so he gave it back to him and a man among the people said: 'O Messenger of Allah, is it unlawful?' He said: 'Bring the man to me.' So he was brought to him. He took the cup from him and called for water. He poured it into the cup, which he raised to his mouth and frowned. Then he called for more water and poured it into it. Then he said: 'When these vessels become strong in taste, pour water on them to weaken them",
