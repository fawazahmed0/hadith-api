We heard them calling the Adhan for the prayer and we started to repeat the Adhan, mocking them. The Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said, 'I heard among these people the Adhan of one who has a beautiful voice.' He sent for us, and we recited the Adhan one by one, and I was the last of them. When I said the Adhan, he said: 'Come here.' He sat me down in front of him and rubbed my forelock and blessed me three times, then he said, 'Go and give the Adhan at the sacred House.' I said: 'How, O Messenger of Allah?' He taught me as you say the Adhan now: 'Allahu Akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar; Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah, Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah; Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulallah, Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulallah, Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah, Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah; Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulallah, Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulallah; Hayya 'alas-salah, Hayya 'ala-salah; Hayya 'alal-falah Hayya 'alal-falah; as-salatu khairun min an-nawm;as-salatu khairun min an-nawm; (Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest; I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah; I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger Allah, I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger Allah; I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah; I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; Come to prayer, come to prayer; come to prosperity, come to prosperity; prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep)' - in the first (Adhan) for As-Subh (Fajr). And he taught me the Iqamah saying each phrase twice: 'Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, (Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar), Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah, Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah; Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulallah, Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulallah; Hayya 'alas-salah, Hayya 'alas-salah; Hayya 'alal-falah, Hayya 'alal-falah; qad qamatis-salah, qad qamati-salah, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar La ilaha illallah (Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, (Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest); I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah ; I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; Come to prayer, come to prayer; come to prosperity, come to prosperity; the prayer is about to begin, the prayer is about to begin, Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest; there is none worthy of worship except Allah).\" (One of the narrators) Ibn Juraij said: ''Uthman narrated this whole report to me from his father and from Umm 'Abdul-Malik bin Abi Mahdhurah, and (said that) they heard that from Abu Mahdhurah","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":7,"hadith":8}}]}
