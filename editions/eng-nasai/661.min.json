Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: Allah sufficed for the believers in the fighting.[1] The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded Bilal to say the Iqamah for Zuhr prayer, and he offered it just as he used to offer it on time. Then he said the Iqamah for 'Asr and he offered it just as he used to offer it on time.
