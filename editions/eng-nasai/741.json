Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasa'i) said:We do not know of anyone who reported anything to support what 'Amr bin Yahya said about praying on a donkey. As for the Hadith of Yahya bin Sa'eed from Anas, what is correct is that it is Mawquf. [1] And Allah knows best. [1] That is a saying or action of a Companion of the Prophet (ﷺ)",
