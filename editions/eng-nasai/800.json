So I went to my former master and told him the same, and he sent with me a camel and vessels of milk, and I brought them via a secret route. Then the time for prayer came and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up and prayed, and Abu Bakr stood to his right. I had come to know about Islam and I was with them, so I came and stood behind them. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) pushed Abu Bakr on the chest (to make him move backward) and we stood behind him.\" Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasai)said: (This) Buraidah is not a reliable narrator of Hadith",
