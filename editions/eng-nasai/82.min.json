Then he made his camel stop and went away until he disappeared from me, then he came back and said: 'Do you have water with you?' I had a water skin with me, so I brought it out and poured it for him. He washed his hands and face and began to wash his arms, but he was wearing a Syrian Jubbah[1] that had narrow sleeves, so he brought his arms out from beneath the Jubbah and washed his hands and arms, and wiped his forelock a little and his turban a little.\" - Ibn 'Awn said: \"I cannot remember it well - then he wiped over his Khuffs.\" Then he said: 'What do you need?' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I do not need anything.' Then we came and 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf was leading the people in Salah, and he had led them in one Rak'ah of the Subh (Fajr) prayer. I wanted to tell him that the Prophet (ﷺ) had arrived but he did not let me, so we prayed what we had caught up with and made up what we had missed.'\" [1] It is a type of cloak","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan Or Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":82}}]}
