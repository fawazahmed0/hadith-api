He led one of the prayers sitting, and we prayed behind him sitting. When he had finished he said:\"The Imam is appointed to be followed. If he prays standing then pray standing; when he bows, bow; when he says, Sami' Allahu liman hamidah (Allah hears those who praise Him), say 'Rabbana lakalhamd (Our Lord, to You be praise); and if he prays sitting then pray sitting, all of you",
