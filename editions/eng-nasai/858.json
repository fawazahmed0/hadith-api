When he finished praying, he saw two men at the back of the people who had not prayed with him. He said: 'Bring them here.' So they were brought to him, trembling. He said: 'What kept you from praying with us? They said: '0 Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) we has already prayed in our lodgings.' He said: 'Do not do that. If you have already prayed in your lodgings, then you come to a Masjid in which there is a congregation, then pray with them, and it will be a voluntary prayer for you",
