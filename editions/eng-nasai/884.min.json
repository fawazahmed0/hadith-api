Go back and pray for you have not prayed.\" He did that three times, then the man said: \"By the One Who sent you with the truth, I cannot do any better than that; teach me.\" He said: \"When you stand to pray, say the Takbir, then recite whatever is easy for you of Quran. Then bow until you have tranquility in your bowing, then stand up until you are standing straight. Then prostrate until you have tranquility in your prostration, then sit up until you have tranquility in your sitting.
