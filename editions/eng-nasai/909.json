And when he says: The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, Allah says: 'My slave has extolled Me.'

And when he says: 'Guide us to the straight way, the way of those on whom You have bestowed Your grace, not (the way) of those who earned Your anger, nor of those who went astray, He says: 'This is for My slave, and My slave shall have what he asked for",
