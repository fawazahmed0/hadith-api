One one occasion (One of the narrators) Shu'bah, indicated (that he wiped) from his forelock to the back of his head, then said:\"I do not know whether he brought his hands back or not. And he washed each foot three times, then he said: 'Whoever would like to see how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) purified himself, this is how he purified himself.'\" Abu 'Abdur-Rahman said: \"This is a mistake.
