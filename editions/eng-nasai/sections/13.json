Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and passed though the rows until he stood in the first row. The people started clapping to let Abu Bakr know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had come. Abu Bakr never used to turn around when he prayed, but when they clapped consistently he realized something must have happened while they were praying. So he turned around and saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gestured to him to stay where he was. Abu Bakr raised his hands and praised and thanked Allah (SWT) for what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said. Then, he moved backwards, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went forward and prayed. When he finished, he said to Abu Bakr: 'What stopped you from continuing to pray when I gestured to you?' Abu Bakr, may Allah (SWT) be pleased with him, said: 'It was not appropriate for the son of Abu Quhafah to lead the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in prayer.' Then he said to the people: 'Why did you clap?' Clapping is for women.' Then he said: 'If you notice something when you are praying, say \"SubhanAllah",
