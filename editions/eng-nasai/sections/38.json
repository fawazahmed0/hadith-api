The Prophet was allocated one-fifth of the Khumus; his relatives were allocated one-fifth of the Khumus; the same was allocated to orphans, the poor and they wayfarers.\" (Da 'if) Abu Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasi) said: Allah, the Majestic is he and Praised, said: \"And know that whatever of spoils of war that you may gain, verily, one-fifth of it is assigned to Allah, and to the Messenger, and to the near relatives ( of the Messenger (Muhammad)), (and also) the orphans, Al-Masakin (the Poor) and the wayfarer.\" His, the Mighty and Sublime, saying to Allah starts the speech since everything is of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, saying to Allah starts the speech since everything is of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. And perhaps He only oened His speech about the Fay and the Khumus, mentioning Himself, because that is the noblest of earnings. And He did not attribute Sadaqah to Himself, the Mighty and Sublime, because that is the dirt of people. And Allah knows best. It was said that something should be taken form the spoils of war and placed inside the Kabah, and this is the share that is for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. The share of the Messenger is to be given to the imam to buy horses and weapons, and to give to whomever he thinks will benefit the people of Islam, and to the people of Hadith, Knowledge, Fiqh and the Quran. The share that is for near relatives should be given to Banu Hashim and Banu Al-Muttablib, rich and poor alike, or it was said that it should be given to the poor among them and not to the rich, such as orphans and wayfarers. This is the view that is more appropriate in my view, and Allah knows best. And the young and the old, male and female, are equal in that, because Allah, the mighty and sublime, has allocated it to them and the Messenger of Allah distributed it among them, and there is nothing in the Hadith to indicate that he preferred some of them over others. And there is no scholarly dispute, as far as we know, to suggest that if a man bequeaths one-third of his wealth to such a tribe, to be distributed out among them equally, that it should be done otherwise, unless the giver stipulated otherwise. And Allah is the source of strength. And (there is) a share for the orphans among the Muslims, and a share for the poor among the Muslims, and a share for the wayfarers among the Muslims. No one should be given both a share for the poor and a share for the wayfarer; it is to be said to him: \"Take whichever of them you want.\" And the other four-fifths are to be divided by the imam among those adult Muslims who were present in the battle.

Then Abu Bakr took control of it, then I took control of it after Abu Bakr, and I did with it what he sued to do. Then these two came to me and asked me to give it to them so that they could dispose of it as the Messenger of Allah disposed of it, and as Abu Bakr disposed of it, and as I disposed of it. So I gave it to them and I took promises from them that they would take proper care of it. Then they came to me and this one said. Give me my share from my brothers son: and this one said: Give me my share from my wife. If they want me to give it to them on the condition that they would dispose of it in the same manner as the Messenger of Allah did, and as Abu Bakr did, and as I did, I would give it to them, but if they refuse, then they do not have to worry about it.' Then he said: 'And know that whatever of spoils of war that you may gain, verily, one-fifth of it is assigned to Allah, and to the Messenger, and to the near relatives (of the Messenger (Muhammad), (and also) the orphans, Al-Masakin (the poor) and the wayfarer' (Al-Anfal 8:41) this if for them.

'And what Allah gave as booty (Fay') to His Messenger (Muhammad) from them - for this you made no expeditin with either cavalry or camels.' Az-Zuhri said: This applies exclusively to the Messenger of Allah and refers to an 'Arab village called Fadak, and so on. What Allah gave as booty (Fay') to His Messenger (Muhammad) from the people of the townships - it is for Allah, His Messenger (Muhammad), the kindred (of Messenger Muhammad), the orphans, Al-Masakin (the poor), and the wayfarer (And there is also a share in this booty) for the poor emigrants, who were expelled from their homes and their property And (it is also for) those who, before them, had homes (in Al-Madinah) and had adopted the Faith And those who came after them. These is no one left among the Muslims but he has some rights to this wealth, except for some of the slaved whom you own.
