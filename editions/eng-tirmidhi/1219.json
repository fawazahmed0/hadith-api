So the Prophet (ﷺ) sold him and Nu'aim [bin 'Abdullah] bin An-Nah-ham bought him.\" Jabir said: \"He was Coptic slave who died during the first year of the leadership of Ibn Az-Zubair.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih and it has been reported through more than one route from Jabir bin 'Abdullah. This Hadith is acted upon according to some of the people of knowledge among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) and others. They did not see any harm in the sale of Mudabbar. This is the view of Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad and Ishaq. There are those among people of knowledge, among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) and others, who disliked selling the Mudabbar. This is the view of Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Malik and Al-Awza'i",
