If someone were to meet them and buy them, then the owner of the goods retains the option when he reaches the market.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Gharib narration of Ayyub (a narrator). The Hadith if Ibn Mas'ud is a Hasan Sahih Hadith. There are those among the people of knowledge who disliked meeting the owners of the goods, saying that it is a type of deception. This is the view of Ash-Shafi'i, and others among our companions",
