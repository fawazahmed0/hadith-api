[Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith of Abu Hurairah is Hasan Sahih Hadith. This Hadith is acted upon according to the people of knowledge, they dislike the Gharar. Ash-Shafi'i said: \"The Gharar sale includes selling fish that are in the wate, selling a slave that has escaped, selling birds that are in the sky, and similar type of sales. And the meaning of Hasah sale is when the seller says to the buyer: 'When I toss the pebble at you, then the sale between you and I is final.'
