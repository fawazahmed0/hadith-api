Hizam: \"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibited me from selling what was not with me.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] Waki' reported this Hadith from Yazid bin Ibrahim, from Ibn Sirin, from Ayyub, from Hakim bin Hizam, and he did not mention in it: \"From Yusuf bin Mahak.\" And the narration of 'Abdus-Samad (a narrator in the chain of Hadith no. 1235) is more correct. Yahya bin Abi Kathir reported this Hadith from Ya'la bin Hakim, from Yusuf bin Mahak, from 'Abdullah bin 'Ismah, from Hakim bin Hizam, from the Prophet (ﷺ). This Hadith is acted upon according to most of the people of knowledge, they dislike for a man to sell what is not with him",
