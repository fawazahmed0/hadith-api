[Abu 'Eisa said:] The Hadith of Samurah is Hasan Sahih Hadith. It is correct that Al-Hasan heard from Samurah, this is what 'Ali bin Al-Madini and others said. Regarding (the prohibition of) bartering animals on credit, this is acted upon according to most of the people of knowledge among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) and others. This is the view of Sufyan Ath-Thawri and the people of Al-Kufah, and it is the view of Ahmad. Some of the people of knowledge, among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) and others, permitted bartering animals for animals on credit. This is the view of Ash-Shafi'i and Ishaq",
