And whoever purchases slave who has property, then his property is for the one who sold him, unless the buyer made it a condition.\" [He said:] There is something on this topic from Jabir. The Hadith of Ibn 'Umar is a Hasan Sahih Hadith. Similarly, it has been reported by more than one route from Az-Zuhri, from Salim, from Ibn 'Umar, that the Prophet (ﷺ) \"Whoever purchases a date-palm after it has been pollinated, then its fruits are for seller, unless the buyer made it a condition. And whoever purchases a slave who has property, then his property is for the seller, unless the buyer made it a condition.\" And it has been reported from Nafi', from Ibn 'Umar, that the Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"Whoever purchases a date-palm that has been pollinated, then its fruits are for the seller, unless the buyer made it a condition.\" It has been reported from Nafi', from Ibn 'Umar, from 'Umar, that he (ﷺ) said: \"Whoever sold a slave who has property, his property is for the seller, unless the buyer made it a condition.\" This is how the two Ahadith were reported by 'Ubaidullah bin 'Umar and others from Nafi'. Some of them have also reported this Hadith from Nafi', from Ibn 'Umar, from the Prophet (ﷺ). 'Ikrimah bin Khalid reported similar to the Hadith of Salim, from Ibn 'Umar, from the Prophet (ﷺ). This Hadith is acted upon according to some of the people of knowledge. It is the view of Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad, and Ishaq. Muhammad bin Isma'il said: \"The Hadith of Az-Zuhri from Salim, from his father, from the Prophet (ﷺ) is the most correct [of what has been reported on this topic]","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":14,"hadith":44}}]}
