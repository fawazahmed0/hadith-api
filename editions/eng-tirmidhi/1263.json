When Al-Ma'idah was revealed I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about it, I said: 'It belongs to an orphan.' He said: 'Spill it out.'\" [He said:] There is something on this topic from Anas bin Malik. [Abu 'Eisa said:] The Hadith of Abu Sa'eed is a Hasan [Sahih] Hadith. Similar to this has been reported through other routes from the Prophet (ﷺ). Some of the people of knowledge stated according to this, they dislike the usage of wine for making vinegar. And the only thing that they disliked about it, and Allah knows best, is for a Muslim to have wine in his house until it becomes vinegar. Abu Al-Waddak's name is Jabr bin Nawf",
