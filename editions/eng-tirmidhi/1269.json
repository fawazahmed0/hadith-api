			"text": "Narrated 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud: That the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"Whoever takes a false oath to deprive a Muslim of his wealth, he will meet Allah while He is angry with him.\" Al-Ash'ath bin Qais said: \"It is about me, by Allah! There was a dispute about some land between myself and a man from the Jews who denied my ownership of it, so I took him to the Prophet (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: 'Do you have any proof ?' I said: 'No'. So he said to Jew: 'Take an oath.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah! If he takes an oath then my property will be gone!' So Allah, Most High revealed: Verily those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah's Covenant and their oaths.. until the end of the Ayah.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] There are narrations on this topic from Wa'il bin Hujr, Abu Musa, Abu Umamah bin Tha'labah Al-Ansari, and 'Imran bin Husain. The Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud is a Hasan Sahih Hadith",
