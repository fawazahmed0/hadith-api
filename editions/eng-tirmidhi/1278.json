He said: 'The most virtuous of what you treat with is cupping.' Or, he said: 'The best of your treatments is cupping.'\" [He said:] There are narrations on this topic from 'Ali, Ibn 'Abbas, and Ibn 'Umar. [Abu 'Eisa said:] The Hadith of Anas is a Hasan Sahih. Some of the people of knowledge among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ), and others permitted paying the cupper. This is the view of Ash-Shafi'i",
