[Abu 'Eisa said:] Muslim bin Khalid Az-Zanji reported this Hadith from Hisham, from 'Urwah. Jarir reported it from Hisham as well. It is said that the narration of Jarir has Tadlis in in it, that Jarir committed the Tadlis, he did not hear it from Hisham bin 'Urwah. As for the meaning of \"the produce is for the responsible one,\" he is the man who purchased the slave then the slave produced for him, and he found some defect in him so he returned him to the seller. Then the produce (of his work) is the purchaser's. In cases similar to this, the produce is for the responsible one. [Abu 'Eisa said:] Muhammad bin Isma'il called this Hadith Gharib, as a narration of 'Umar bin 'Ali (one of the narrators). I said: \"Do you think that he committed Tadlis?\" He said:\"No",
