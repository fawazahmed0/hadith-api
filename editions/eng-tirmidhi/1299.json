[Abu 'Eisa said:] The Hadith of Ibn 'Abbas (ra), is a Hasan Sahih Hadith. This Hadith is acted upon according to soe of the people of knowledge among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ). They said whoever gives a gift to a closely related relative, then he is not to take back his gift. And whoever gives a gift to someone other then a close relative, then he may take it back as long as it has not been reciprocated. This is the view of Ath-Thawri. Ash-Shafi'i said: \"It is not lawful for any that has given a gift to take it back except for what the father gave to his son.\" Ash-Shafi'i argued with the Hadith of 'Abdullah bin 'Umar from the Prophet (ﷺ): \"It is not lawful for anyone that has given a gift to take it back, except for a father who give something to his son",
