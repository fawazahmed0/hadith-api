[He said:] There are narrations on this topic from Abu Hurairah and Jabir. [Abu 'Eisa said:] The Hadith if Zaid bin Thabit: This is how Muhammad bin Ishaq reported this Hadith. Ayyub, 'Ubaidullah bin 'Umar, and Malik bin Anas reported it from Nafi', from 'Ibn Umar: \"The Prophet (ﷺ) prohibited Al-Muhalaqah and Al-Muzabanah.\" With this chain of narration, it has been reported from Ibn 'Umar, from Zaid bin Thabit, from the Prophet (ﷺ) that he permitted Al-'Araya in cases less that five Wasq. This is more correct than the narration of Muhammad bin Ishaq",
