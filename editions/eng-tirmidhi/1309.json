			"text": "Narrated Ibn 'Umar: That the Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"Procrastination (in paying a debt) by a rich person is oppression. So if your debt is transfered from your debtor you should agree, and do not make two sales in one sale.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] The Hadith is the Abu Hurairah (no. 1308) is a Hasan Sahih Hadith. And its meaning is that when the debt of one of you is transferred then agree. Some of the people of knowledge said when a man is offered to transfer his debt to a rich man and he does so, then the transferor is free of it, he is not to seek its return from the transferor. This is the view of Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad, and Ishaq. Some of the people of knowledge said: \"When this wealth could not be collected due to bankruptcy of the one it was transferred to, then he may seek its return to the first one.\" They argue this view with the saying of 'Uthman and others, when they said: \"There is nothing due on a Muslim's wealth that is lost.\" Ishaq said: \"The meaning of this Hadith: 'There is nothing due on a Muslim's wealth that is lost' this is when a man transfers it to another whom he thinks is wealthy, then he becomes bankrupt, so there is nothing due on the Muslim's wealth that is lost",
