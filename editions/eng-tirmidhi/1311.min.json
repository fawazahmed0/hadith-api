So he said: 'Whoever pays in advance, then let him pay in advance for known measurements (of dates), and known weights for a specified period of time.'\" He said: There are narrations on this topic from Ibn Abi Awfa and 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abza. [Abu 'Eisa said:] The Hadith of Ibn 'Abbas is a Hasan Sahih Hadith. This is acted upon according to the people of knowledge among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) and others. They allow for advanced payments on food, garments and other things in which the limits and description are known. They differed over delay in delivery of animals. Some of the people of knowledge among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) and others thought that delay in delivery of animals is allowed. This is the view of Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad and Ishaq. Some of the people of knowledge among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) and others, disliked delay in delivery of animals. This is the saying of Sufyan and the people of Al-Kufah.
