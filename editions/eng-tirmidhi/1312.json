I heard Muhammad bin Isma'il saying: It is said that \"Sulaiman Al-Yashkuri died during the lifetime of Jabir bin 'Abdullah.\" He said: \"And Qatadah did not hear from him, nor did Abu Bishr.\" Muhammad said: \"We do not know of any of them hearing from Sulaiman Al-Yashkuri except that 'Amr bin Dinar possibly heard from his during the lifetome of Jabir bin 'Abdullah.\" He said: \"Qatadah only narrated from a writing of Sulaiman Al-Yashkuri, and he has a book from Jabir bin 'Abdullah.\" Abu Bakr Al-'Attar 'Abdul Quddus narrates to us, he said: \" 'Ali bin Al-Madini said: 'Yahya bin Sa'eed said: \"Sulaiman At-Taymi said: 'They went with the book of Jabir bin 'Abdullah to Al-Hasan Al-Basri and he took it' - or he said - 'and they reported it. Then they took it to Qatadah and reported it, so they gave it to me but I did not report it [he said: 'I refused it'] This was narrated to us by Abu Bakr Al-'Attar from 'Ali bin Al-Madini",
