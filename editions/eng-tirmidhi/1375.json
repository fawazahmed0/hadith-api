I got some wealth from Khaibar and I never ever had any wealth as plentiful as it, so what do you order me (to do with it)?' He said: 'If you wish, make it a grant and give charity from it.' So 'Umar gave it in charity: That is not to be sold entirely, nor given away, nor inherited, to be used to produce charity for the needy, those who are near it, for freeing slaves, for the cause of Allah, the wayfarer, the guest, and that there is no harm on its custodian consuming what is customary from it, or eating from its charity, without trying to amass wealth from it",
