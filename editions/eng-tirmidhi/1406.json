Whoever believes in Allah, and the Last Day, then let them not shed blood in it, nor cut down any of its trees. If one tries to make an excuse by saying: 'It was made lawful for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)' then indeed Allah made it lawful for me but He did not make it lawful for the people, and it was only made lawful for me for an hour of a day. Then it is returned to being sacred until the Day of Judgement. Then, to you people of Khuza'ah who killed this man from Hudhail: I am his 'Aqil, so whomever (one of his relatives) is killed after today, then his people have two options; either they have him killed, or they take the blood-money from him",
