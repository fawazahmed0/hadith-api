So one of them stood before him and said: \"I ask you by Allah, O Messenger of Allah! Only that you would judge between us by the book of Allah.\" So his disputant said - and he was more eloquent that him: \"I agree of O Messenger of Allah! Judge between us by the Book of Allah, and allow me to speak. My son was a servant for this man and he committed adultery with his wife. So they told me that my son was to be stoned. I paid him one hundred female sheep and a female slave. Then I met some people from the people of knowledge and they said that my son was to be lashed one hundred times, and to be banished for a year and that stoning is only for this man's wife.\" So the Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"By the One in Whose Hand is my soul! I will judge between you two by the Book of Allah. The one hundred female sheep and the female slave should be returned to you. For your son is one hundred lashes and banishment for a year. O Unais! Go to this Man's wife, and if she confesses then stone her.\" He went to her and she confessed, so he stoned her","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":17,"hadith":13}},{"hadithnumber":1433.2,"arabicnumber":1433.2,"text":"(Another chain) with similar","grades":[],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":0}},{"hadithnumber":1433.3,"arabicnumber":1433.3,"text":"(Another chain) with similar","grades":[],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":0}}]}
