So he ordered Bilal to call the Iqamah when Fajr began, then he ordered him to call the Iqamah when the Sun passed the zenith, then he prayed Zuhr. Then he ordered him to call the Iqamah to pray Asr while the sun was elevated and white. Then he ordered him (to call the Iqamah for) Maghrib when the (top) edge of the sun had set. Then he ordered him to call the Iqamah for Isha when the horizon (twilight) had vanished. Then he ordered him in the morning (to give the call for Fajr prayer), when the light of Fajr glowed. Then he ordered (him to call the Iqamah for) Zuhr, so he waited well until it had cooled. Then he ordered (him to call the Iqamah for) Asr, so he calIed the Iqamah while the sun was later in its position than what it was (the day before). Then he ordered him to delay Maghrib until right before the twilight had disappeared. Then he ordered (him to call the Iqamah for) Isha, so he called the Iqamah when a third of the night had passed. Then he said: 'Where is the one who asked about he times for the Salat?' So the man said, 'It is I.' So he said: 'The times [or the Salat are what are between these two]",
