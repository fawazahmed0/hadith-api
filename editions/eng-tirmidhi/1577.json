			"text": "Narrated 'Iyad bin Himar: That he gave the Prophet (ﷺ) a gift or a camel, so the Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"Have you accepted Islam?\" He said: \"No.\" He said: \"Then I have been prohibited from the Zabd (gift) of the idolaters.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. And the meaning of his saying: \"I haven been prohibited from the Zabd (gifts) of the idolaters\" is their gifts. It has been reported about the Messenger (ﷺ) that he used to accept the gifts of the idolaters while a dislike for that is mentioned in this Hadith. And the implication is that this was after he used to accept from them, and then he later forbade their gifts",
