He was making an expedition into their lands so that when the period of the treaty was expires he would attack them. So when a man upon an animal' - or - 'upon a horse said: \"Allahu Akbar! Fulfillment not betrayal!\" - and it turned out to be 'Amr bin 'Abasah - Mu'awiyah asked him about that. He said: \"I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Whoever has a treaty between himself and a people, then let him not violate the treaty nor try to change it until its time has passed, or , in retribution for a similar offense.'\" He said: \"So Mu'awiyah returned with the people.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih",
