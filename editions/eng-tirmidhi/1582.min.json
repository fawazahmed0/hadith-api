So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) tried to stop it with fire, but it made his arm bleed profusely so he left it. Then he did it another time but it caused it to bleed profusely. Upon seeing that he said: 'O Allah! Do not allow my soul depart until my eyes are comforted by elimination of Banu Quraizah.' He pressed his vein closed and it did not bleed a drop before they surrendered to the arbitration of Sa'd bin Mu'adh. He (the Prophet (ﷺ)) sent to him (Sa'd) who judged that their men should be killed, their women should be spared, and that the Muslims may share them among themselves. With this, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'You have judged according to Allah's judgement for them.' And they were four hundred. Then when he finished killing them, his vein opened up and he died.\" [He said:] There are narrations on this topic from Abu Sa'eed and 'Atiyyah Al-Qurazi.
