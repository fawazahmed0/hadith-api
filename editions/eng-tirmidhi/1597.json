			"text": "Ibn Al-Munkadir heard Umaimah bin Ruqaiqah saying:\"I pledged to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) along with some women. He said to us: 'In as much as you are able and capable.' I said: 'Allah and His Messenger are more merciful to us than we are to ourselves,' then I said: 'O Messenger of Allah take the pledge from us.'\" - Sufyan (one of the narrators) said: meaning: 'shake (hands) on it with us' - \"so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'My statement to one hundred women is like my statement to one.'\" [He said:] There are narrations on this topic from 'Aishah, from 'Abdullah bin 'Umar, and Asma' bint Yazid. [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know of it except as a narration of Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir. Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Malik bin Anas, and others reported this Hadith from Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir similarly. He said: I asked Muhammad about this Hadith and he said: \"I am not aware of a Hadith other than this from Umaimah bint Ruqaiqah.\" There is another woman named Umaimah who narrated from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)",
