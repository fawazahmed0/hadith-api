			"text": "Narrated 'Abayah bin Rifa'ah: From his father, from his grandfather Rafi' bin Khadij, who said: \"We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on a journey, when the hasty people went rushing ahead to the sheep to cook them, while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was in the rear of the people. Then he passed the kettled and ordered that they be weighed, then he distributed it between them and equated a camel to ten sheep.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] Sufyan Ath-Thawri reported it from his father, from 'Abayah, from his grandfather Rafi' bin Khadij, and he did not mention \"from his father\" in it. This was narrated to us by Mahmud bin Ghailan (who said:) \"Waki' narrated it to us from Sufyan.\" And this is more correct. 'Abayah bin Rifa'ah heard from his grandfather Rafi' bin Khadij. He said: There are narrations on this topic from Tha'labah bin Al-Hakam, Anas, Abu Rihanah, Abu Ad-Darda, 'Abdur-Rahman bin Samurah, Zaid bin Khalid, Jabir, Abu Hurairah, and Abu Ayyub",
