There is something on this topic from Samurah. [Abu 'Eisa said:] Most of the companions of Isma'il said: \"From Isma'il, from Qais bin Abu Hazim, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent a military expedition.\" and they did not mention: \"from Jarir\" in it. Hammad bin Salamah reported similar to the narration of Abu Mu'awiyah, from Al-Hajjaj bin Artah, from Isma'il bin Abi Khalid, from Qais from Jarir [He said:] I heard Muhammad saying: \"What is correct is the narration of Qais from the Prophet (ﷺ) in Mursal form.\" Samurah bin Jundab repoted that the Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"Do not live among the idolaters, and do not assemble with them, for whoever lives among them or assembles with them then he is similar to them","grades":[{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":68}}]}
