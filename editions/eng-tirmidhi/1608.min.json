He said: 'My family and my son.' She said: 'So what about me? I do not get inheritance from my father?' So Abu Bakr said: 'I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: 'We are not inherited from' but I support those whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to support, and I spend upon those whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spent upon.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] There are narrations on this topic from 'Umar, Talhah, Az-Zubair, 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf, Sa'd and 'Aishah. The Hadith of Abu Hurairah is Hasan Gharib from this route. It is only reported with a chain by Hammad bin Salamah and 'Abdul Wahhab bin 'Ata, from Muhammad bin 'Amr, from Abu Salamah, from Abu Hurairah. I asked Muhammad about this Hadith and he said: \"No one is known to have reported it from Muhammad bin 'Amr, from Abu Salamah, from Abu Hurairah except from Hammad bin Salamah. 'Abdul Wahhab bin 'Ata reported it from Muhammad bib 'Amr, from Abu Salamah, and from Abu Hurairah and it is similar to the narration of Hammad bin Salamah. And this Hadith has been reported through other routes from Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, from the Prophet (ﷺ)","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":71}}]}
