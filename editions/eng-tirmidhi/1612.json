And if it was the middle of the daytime, he would wait until the sun passed the zenit, and when it passed the zenith he would fight until 'Asr. Then he would wait until he prayed 'Asr, then he would fight.\" He said: \"And it is used to be said during that (time) the the wind of victory was raging, and the believers would supplicate for their armies in their Salat.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith has been reported from An-Nu'man bin Muqarrin through a chain that is more connected that this. Qatadah did not see An-Nu'man bin Muqarrin. An-Nu'man died during the Khilafah of 'Umar",
