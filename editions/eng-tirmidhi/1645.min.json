Umm Haram was the wife of 'Ubadah bin As-Samit. Once the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) visited her and she provide him with some food and started inspecting this head for lice. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) slept and afterwards he awoke smiling. She said: 'I said: \"What causes you to smile, O the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ?\" He said: \"Some of my followers who were displayed before me )in a dream) as fighters in Allah's cause, riding on a ship this ocean who were kings upon thrones, or like kings upon thrones.\" I said: \"O Messenger of Allah! Supplicate to Allah to make me among them.'\" So he supplicated for her. Then he lay down his head to sleep. Then he woke up and he was smiling. She said: 'So I said to him: \"What causes you to smile, O the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?\" He said: \"Some of my followers who were displayed before me (in a dream) as fighters in Allah's cause,\" and he said similar to what he said earlier. She said: 'I said: \"O Messenger of Allah! Supplicate to Allah to make me among them.\" He said: \"You are the earlier ones.'\" He said: \"So Umm Haram rode on the sea during the time of Mu'awiyah bin Abu Sufyan. She was thrown from the riding animal after she arrived from the ocean voyage, and she died.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. Umm Haram bint Milhan is the daughter of Umm Sulaim, the maternal aunt of Anas bin Malik","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":22,"hadith":28}}]}
