So he said: 'I should leave the people and stay in this ravine. But I will not do it until I seek permission from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).' So he mentioned that to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he said: 'Do not do so. For indeed one of you standing in the cause of Allah is more virtuous that his Salat in his house for seventy years. Do you not love that Allah forgive your sins and admit you into Paradise ? Then fight in the cause of Allah, for whoever fights in Allah's cause for the time it takes for two milkings of a camel, then Paradise is obligatory for him.'\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan",
