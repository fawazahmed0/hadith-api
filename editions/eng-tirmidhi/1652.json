Shall I not inform you of the one who comes after him ? The man who secludes himself from the people with a small group of sheep of his, thereby fulfilling Allah's right. Shall I not inform you about the worst of the people ? A man who is asked by (the Name of) Allah, but not given by Him.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Gharib from this route.
