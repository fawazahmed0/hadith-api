He tried to get up on a boulder but was not able to, so Talhah squatted under him, lifting the Prophet (ﷺ) upon it such that he could sit on the boulder. So he said: (Paradise) \"It is obligated from Talhah.'\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] There are narrations on this topic from Safwan bin Umayyah and As-Sa'ib bin Yazid. This Hadith is Hasan Gharib, we do not know of it except through the narration of Muhammad bin Ishaq",
