Then a man stood and said: \"O Messenger of Allah! If I were killed in the cause of Allah, would my sins forgiven ?\" So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"Yes, If you are killed in Allah's cause, and you are patient, seeking the reward, advancing, not fleeing.\" Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"What was it that you said?\" So he replied: \"If I were killed in the cause of Allah, would my sins be removed (forgiven)?\" So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"Yes, If you are patient, seeking the reward, advancing, not fleeing - except debt. For Jibril said that to me.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] There are narrations on this topic from Anas, Muhammad bin Jahsh, And Abu Hurairah. This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. Some of them reported this Hadith from Sa'eed Al-Maqburi, from Abu Hurairah, from the Prophet (ﷺ) similar to this. Yahya bin Sa'eed Al-Ansari and more than one narrator reported this from Sa'eed Al-Maqburi from 'Abdullah bin Abi Qatadah, from his fahter, from the Prophet (ﷺ). This is more correct than the narration of Sa'eed Al-Maqburi from Abu Hurairah",
