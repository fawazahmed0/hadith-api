So we arrived in Al-Madinah and concealed ourselves in it and we said: 'We are ruined.' Then we went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and we said: 'O Messenger of Allah! We are those who fled.' He said: 'Rather you are Al-'Akkarun (those who are regrouping) and I am your reinforcement. [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Gharib. We do not know of it except as a narration of Yazid bin Abi Ziyad. And the meaning of his saying: \"The people turned to escape\" is that they fled from the fighting. As for the meaning of his saying: \"Rather you are Al-'Akkarun,\" the 'Akkar is the one who flees to his Imam in order that he may help him, it does not mean fleeing from the advancing army","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":23,"hadith":50}}]}
