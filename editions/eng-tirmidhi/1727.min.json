The Hadith of Ibn 'Abbas is Hasan Sahih. Similar to this has been reported through other routes from Ibn 'Abbas from the Prophet (ﷺ). And it has been related from Ibn 'Abbas from Maimunah, from the Prophet (ﷺ), and, it has been related from him from Sawdah. I heard Muhammad saying the Hadith of Ibn 'Abbas from Maimunah from the Prophet (ﷺ) were correct. And he said: \"It implies that it was reported from Ibn 'Abbas from Maimunah from the Prophet (ﷺ), and that Ibn 'Abbas reported it from the Prophet (ﷺ), and he did not mention Maimunah in it.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This is acted upon according to most of the people of knowledge, and it is the view of Sufyan At-Thawri, Ibn Al-Mubarak, Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad, and Ishaq","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":24,"hadith":8}}]}
