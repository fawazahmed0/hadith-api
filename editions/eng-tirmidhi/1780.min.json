And beware of gatherings of the rich, and do not consider a garment to be worn out until it has been patched.'\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Gharib, we do not know of it except as a narration of Salih bin Hassan. He said: I heard Muhammad bin Isma'il saying: \"Salih bin Hassan is Munkar is Hadith.\" And Salih bin Hassan - the one who Ibn Abi Dhi'b reports from - is trustworthy. [Abu 'Eisa said:] The meaning of this saying: \"And beware of gathering of the rich\" is similar to what was related from Abu Hurairah from the Prophet (ﷺ), that he said: \"Whoever sees one that has been more favored than him in appearance and provision, then let him look at the one who is less than him, rather than one who is favored more than him. For indeed it is more appropriate so that he not scorn Allah's favors [upon him].\" And it has been related from 'Awn bin 'Abdullah who said: \"I accompanied the rich, and did not see anyone with more troubles than me. I saw a beast that was better than my beast, and a garment that was better than my garment. And I accompanied the poor, and felt at ease","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Very Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Very Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":24,"hadith":68}}]}
