Abu 'Eisa said: This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. This is how it was reported by more than one narrator, from 'Amr bin Dinar from Jabir. Hammad bin Zaid reported it from 'Amr bin Dinar from Muhammad bin 'Ali, from Jabir. The narration of Ibn 'Uyainah (no. 1793) is more correct. He said: I heard Muhammad saying: \"Sufyan bin 'Uyainah is better at memorizing than Hammad bin Zaid","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":25,"hadith":6}}]}
