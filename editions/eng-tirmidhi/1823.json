Destroy the locusts, kill the large among him, and destroy the small, spoil his core, and cut off his rear. Take their mouths from our livelihood and our sustenance. Verily, You indeed listen to the supplication!' So a man said: 'O Messenger of Allah! How is it that you supplicate against one of the Allah's armies that He cut off their rear?'\" He said: \"So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'They are bit scattered from a fish in the ocean.'\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Gharib. We do not know of it except from this route. And Musa bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim At-Taimi has been criticized. He narrates many Gharib and Munkar narrations. His father Muhammad bin Ibrahim is trustworthy, and he is from Al-Madinah",
