I said: 'No, except a piece of hard bread and vinegar.' so he said: 'Bring it, for a house that has vinegar is not impoverished of condiments.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Gharib from this route. We do not know of it as a Hadith of Umm Hani' except through this route. Abu Hamzah Ath-Thumali's (a narrator in the chain) name is Thabit bin Abi Safiyyah. And Umm Hani' died some time after 'Ali bin Abi Talib. I asked Muhammad about this Hadith. He said: \"I do not know Ash-Sha'bi hearing from Umm Hani'.\" So I said: \"How is Abu Hamzah according to you?\" He said: \"Ahmad bin Hanbal criticized him, but he is Muqarib (average) in Hadith to me",
