If he returns to it, then Allah will not accepts his Salat for forty days. If he repents, then Allah will accept his repentance. If he returns to it a fourth time, Allah will not accept his Salat for forty days, and if he were to repent, Allah would not accept his repentance, and he will be given to drink from the river of Al-Khabal.\" They said: \"O Aby 'Abdur-Rahman! What is the river of Al-Khabal?\" He said: \"A river of the pus from the inhabitants of the Fire.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan.
