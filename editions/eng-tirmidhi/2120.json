And whoever claims someone other than his father, or an affiliation with other than his Mawali, then upon him is the continued curse of Allah until the Day of Judgment. The wife is not to spend from her husband's house except with her husband's permission.' They said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Not even food?' He said: 'That is the most virtuous of our wealth.' And he said: 'The borrowed is to be returned, the endowment is to be refunded and the debt is to be repaid, and the guarantor is responsible",
