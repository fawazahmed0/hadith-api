They said: \"If she wants the reward for (freeing) you while the Wala is for us, then let her do it.\" So I mentioned that to the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) and the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said: \"Buy her, then free her, for the Wala is only for the one who frees.\" Then the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) stood and said: \"What is the case of people who make conditions that are not in Allah's Book?
