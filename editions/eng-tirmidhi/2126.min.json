[Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. We do not know of it except as a narration of 'Abdullah bin Dinar from Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet (ﷺ). Shu'bah, Sufyan Ath-Thawri, and Malik bin Anas (also) reported it from 'Abdullah bin Dinar. It has been related that Shu'bah said: \"I so wished that 'Abdullah bin Dinar would permit me when he narrated this Hadith that I stand-up, so that I kiss his head.\" And Yahya bin Sulaim reported this Hadith from 'Ubaidullah bin 'Umar from Nafi', from Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet (ﷺ). But this is mistaken, Yahya bin Sulaim erred in it, what is correct is: \"From 'Ubaidullah bin 'Umar, from 'Abdullah bin Dinar, from Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet (ﷺ). This is how it is reported by more than one narrator from 'Ubaidullah bin 'Umar. [Abu 'Eisa said:] And 'Abdullah bin Dinar is alone with this Hadith","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":31,"hadith":2}}]}
