And the parable of the one who gives a gift, and then takes it back, is that of a dog who eats until he is full, and vomits, then he returns to his vomit.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. Ash-Shafi'i said: \"It is not lawful for one who confers something to take it back, except in the case of the father. He may take back what he gave his son\" and he used this Hadith as proof",
