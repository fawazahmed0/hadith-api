There is no spot, the size of four fingers in them, except that there is an angel placing his forehead in it, prostrating to Allah. By Allah! If you knew what I know, then you would laugh little and you would cry much. And you would not taste the pleasures of your women in the beds, and you would go out beseeching Allah. And I wish that I was but a felled tree.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] There are narrations on this topic from 'Aishah, Abu Hurairah, Ibn 'Abbas, and Anas. [He said:] This Hadith is Hasan Gharib. It has been related through routes other than this, that Abu Dharr said: \"I wish that I was a felled tree.\" And it has been related from Abu Dharr in Mawquf form",
