Did you not think that you would have to meet with Me on this Day of yours?' So he will say: 'No.' So it will be said to him: 'Today you shall be forgotten just as you have forgotten Me.'\" [Abü 'Elsa said:] This Hadith is Sahih Gharib and the meaning of His saying: \"Today you shall be forgotten just as you have forgotten Me\" is: Today I shall leave you in chastisement. [This is how they have explained it]. [Abu 'Eisa said:] This is how some of the people of knowledge have explained this Ayah: So this Day We shall forget them...They said that it means: We shall leave them in chastisement",
