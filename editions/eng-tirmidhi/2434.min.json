Then he said: 'I will be the 'Leader' of the people on the Day of Resurrection. Do you know why that is? Allah will gather the people, the first and the last, on one level ground where they will (all) be able to hear a caller, and all of them will be visible, and the sun will be brought near such that the people will suffer distress and trouble that they cannot tolerate nor bear. Then some people will say: \"Don't you see the state you have reached? Why don't you look for a person who can intercede for you with your Lord? \" Some of them will say to others: \" You should go to Adam.\" So they will go to Adam and say, \"You are the father of all mankind, Allah created you with His Own Hands, and breathed into you from His spirit (which He creted for you) and ordered the angels to prostrate for you. Will you not intercede for us with your Lord? Don't you see what has happened to us? Don't you see the state we have reached?\" On that Adam will reply, \"Today my Lord has become angry such that He has never before been angry, and will never be thereafter. He forbade me (to eat from) the tree, but I disobeyed(Him), Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to somebody else; Go to Nuh.\" They will go to Nuh and say: \"O Nuh! You are the first among the Messengers to the people of the earth, and Allah named you a thankful slave. Will you not intercede for us with your Lord? Don't you see what has happened to us? Don't you see the state we have reached?\" Nuh will say to them : \"Today my Lord has become angry as He has never before been angry, and will never be thereafter. I had been given one supplication, and I supplicated against my own people. Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else! Go to Ibrahim.\" They will go to Ibrahim and say: \"O Ibrahim! You are Allah's Prophet and His Khalil among the people of the earth, so intercede for us with your Lord, don't you see what hads happened to us?\" He will say: \"Today my Lord has become angry as He has never before been angry and will never be thereafter. Indeed I uttered three lies.\"- Abu Hayyyan (a narrator) mentioned them in his narration - \" Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else! Go to Musa.\" So they will go to Musa and say: \"O Musa! You are the Messenger of Allah who Allah distinguished above the people with His Message and His Speech, intercede for us with your Lord. Don't you see what has happened to us?\" So he will say \"Today my Lord has become angry as He has never before been angry and will never be thereafter. Indeed I killed a person whom I was ordered not to kill. Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; Go to 'Eisa.\" They will go to 'Eisa and say: \"O 'Eisa ! You are the Messenger of Allah and His Word which He placed into Mariam, and a Spirit from Him, and you spoke to the people in the cradle. Intercede for us with your Lord. Don't you see what has happened to us?\" Then 'Eisa will say: \"Today my Lord has become angry as He has never before been angry and will never be thereafter.\" He will not mention a sin, but will say: \"Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else! Go to Muhammad.\" He said: 'They will go to Muhammad(s.a.w) and they say: \"O Muhammad! You are the Messenger of Allah and the last of the Prophets, and your past and future sins have been pardoned. Will you not intercede for us with your Lord, don't you see what has happened to us?\" Then I will depart until I come to under the Throne to fall prostrating before my Lord. Then Allah will guide me to such praises and beautiful statements of glorification which He did not guide anyone to before me. Then He will say: \"O Muhammad! Raise your head. Ask,so that you may be granted and intercede so that your intercession may be accepted.\" I will raise my head and say: \"O Lord! My Ummah! O Lord! My Ummah! O Lord! My Ummah!\" He will say: \"O Muhammad! Let those of your Ummah who have no accounts enter the gate on the right among the gates of Paradise, and they shall share in the gates other than that with the people.'\" Then he (s.a.w) said: 'By the One in Whose Hand is my soul! What is between every two gate-posts in Paradise is as what is between Makkah and Hajar, and what is between Makkah and Busra.'\" Other chains report similar narrations","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":20}}]}
