There was a large multitude that covered the horizon, from one side to the other. It was said: 'These people are your Ummah, and there are seventy thousand besides these from your Ummah that shall enter Paradise without a reckoning.' So he went inside, and they did not question him, and he gave no explanation to them. (Some of them) said: 'We are them.' Others said: 'They are the children who were born upon the Fitrah and Islam.'
