And the incapable is the one who follows his desires and merely hopes in Allah.\" [He said:] The meaning of his saying: \"Who subjugates his soul\", is to say the one who reckons with his soul in the world, before he is reckoned with, on the Day of Judgement. It has been related that 'Umar bin Al-Khattäb said: \"Reckon with yourselves before you are reckoned with, and prepare for the Greatest Inquisition. The reckoning of the Day of Judgement is only light for the one who reckoned with himself in the world.\" And, it has been related that Maimun bin Mihran said: \"The slave (of Allah) will not be a Taqi until he has reckoned himself, just as he would account for where his business partner got his food and clothing","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":45}}]}
