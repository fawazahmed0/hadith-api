Then I asked him (again) and he gave it to me. Then I asked him (again) and he gave it to me. Then I asked him (again), so he gave it to me. Then he said: 'O Hakim! Indeed this wealth is green and sweet, so whoever takes it without asking for it, he will be blessed in it. And whoever takes it, insisting upon it, he will not be blessed in it. He is like the one who eats but does not get satisfied and contended. And the upper hand (giving) is better than the lower hand (receiving).\" So Hakim said: \"I said: 'O Messenger of Allah! By the One who sent you with the Truth! I shall not ask anyone for anything after you until I depart the world.'\"So Abu Bakr used to call Hakim to give him something, but he refused to accept it. Then 'Umar called him to give to him, but he refused to accept it. So 'Umar said: \"O you Muslims! I would like you to bear witness that I presented Hakim with his due of these spoils of war but he refused to accept it.\" So Hakim never asked anyone of the people for anything after the Messenger of Allah, until he died","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":49}}]}
