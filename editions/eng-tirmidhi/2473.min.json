I had taken a tanned skin, si I tore it in the middle, and out it over my neck, and wrapped my mid-section, fastening it with a palm leave. I was severely hungry, and if there was food in the house of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) I would have eaten some of it. I went in search of something.

He said: \"what is wrong with you O Arab1 Would you like to get a date for every bucket?\" I said: \"Yes. Open the door so I can come in.\" He opened the door, I entered and he gave me his bucket.
