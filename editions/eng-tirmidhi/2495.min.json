All of you are astray except whom I guide, so ask Me for guidance and I shall guide you. All of you are poor except whom I enrich, so ask Me and I shall provide you. All of you are sinners except whom I have pardoned, so whoever among you knows that I am the One able to forgive, and seeks My forgiveness, I shall forgive him, without concern for Me (and it will not affect Me). If the first of you and the last of you, the living among you and the dead among you, the fresh among you and the dry among you were to gather together to help the heart with the most Taqwa among My slaves, that would not add a mosquito's wing to My sovereignty. If the first of you and the last of you, the living among you and the dead among you, the fresh among you and the dry among you were to gather together to help the worst heart of My slaves, that would not diminish a mosquito's wing to My sovereignty. I shall forgive him, without concern for Me (and it will not affect Me). If the first of you and the last of you, the living among you and the dead among you, the fresh among you and the dry among you were to gather together upon one plateau, and each person among them were to ask for his utmost desire, and I were to give each what he asked for, that would not diminish from My sovereignty, except as if one of you were to pass by an ocean and dip a needle into it and then remove it. That is because I am the Most Liberal without need, the Most Generous, doing as I will. I give by My speech and I punish by My speech, whenever I will something I only say: \"Be\" and it shall be.'\" Another chain reports a similar narration","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":81}}]}
