As for those whom Allah loves: Then a man who came to a people and asked them by Allah, and he did not ask them due to any relation between him and them, but they did not give him. So a man stayed behind them and gave him secretly, none knew about what he gave except Allah and the one he gave. And, a group of people who traveled the night until when sleep became more beloved to them than all the things that equal it and they lay their heads down, but a man stoop up humbling himself to Me and reciting My Ayat. And a man who was in a small expedition and met the enemy and they were vanquished, yet he faced them until he was killed or victory was granted to him. And the three whom Allah hates are, the old man who commits adultery, the arrogant poor man, and the oppressive rich man.\" Another chain reports a similar narration",
