So they will (again) seek food to relieve (their hunger), and they will be given to eat of a food that causes one to choke. Then they will remember that they used remedy for choking in the world by drinking something. So they will seek relief from drink. Then they will be given Hamim with meat hooks, so when it comes toward their faces it melts their faces, and when it enters their insides it cuts up what is inside of them. So (some of them) say: 'Call the keepers of Hell' so they say: Did there not come to you your Messengers with clear signs? They say: 'Yes!' They say: 'Then call as you like.' And the invocation of the disbelievers is nothing but in vain.\" He said: \"They will say: 'Call Malik.' So they say: O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us!'\" He said: \"So he answers them: Verily you shall abide forever. Al-A'mash said: \"I was informed that there is a thousand years between their calling him, and Malik's answering them.\" He said: \"They say: 'Call your Lord, for there is none better than your Lord.' So they will say: Our Lord! Our wretchedness over came us, and we were (an) erring people. Our Lord! Bring us out of this. If we ever return (to evil), indeed we shall be wrong doers.\"He said: \"So the reply to them is: You remain in it in ignominy! And do not speak to Me.\" He said: \"So with that, they loose hope of any good, and with that they are taken to moaning, despair and severe ruin","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":39,"hadith":14}}]}
