So the Lord, Blessed and Exalted, will say: 'Take them out.' Then when they are taken out He will say: 'What caused you to scream so violently?' They will say: 'We did that so You would have mercy on us.' He will say: 'My mercy for you is that you both go and throw yourselves where you were in the Fire.' So they will go. One of them will throw himself in, and He will make it cool and peaceful for him. And the other will stand there and not throw himself in, so the Lord, Mighty and Majestic, will say to him: 'What prevented you from throwing yourself in as your companion did?' He will say: 'O Lord! I hope that you will not return me to it aftrr You have taken me out.' So the Lord, Blessed and Exalted, will say to him: 'For you is what you hoped for,' and so they will both enter Paradise together by the mercy of Allah","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":39,"hadith":27}}]}
