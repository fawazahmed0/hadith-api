But there was no one who would accept us. So we went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he brought us to his family where there were three goats. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Milk these.' We milked them, and each person drank his share, and we put aside a share for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).

Then he went to the Masjid to per form Salat. Then he went for his drink and drank it",
