So I sat down, and then I saw a group of people, and he was among them, but I did not recognize him. He was settling some matter between them so when he was finished, some of them stood up with him and they were saying: 'O Messenger of Allah.' When I saw that, I said: \"'Alaikas-Salam (upon you be peace) O Messenger of Allah! 'Alaikas-Salam (upon you be peace) O Messenger of Allah! 'Alaikas-Salam (upon you be peace) O Messenger of Allah!' He replied: 'Indeed \"'Alaikas-Salam (upon you be peace)\" is the greeting for the dead.' Then he came toward me and said: 'When a man meets his Muslim brother then he should say: \"As-Salamu 'Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh (peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of Allah).\" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) responded to my greeting, he said: 'And may Allah's mercy be upon you, and may Allah's mercy be upon you, and may Allah's mercy be upon you","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":42,"hadith":34}}]}
