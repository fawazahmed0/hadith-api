So he went and knocked at the door, so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood naked (1), dragging his garment - and by Allah! I did not see him naked before nor afterwards - and he hugged him and kissed him.\" (1) They say that the meaning of naked here is that he was not wearing his Rida or upper wrap and it was that which was dragging, so the area between the navel and knees were covered.
