			"text": "Narrated Jabir:The Prophet (ﷺ) would not sleep until he recited Alif Lam Mim Tanzil and: Tabarak Alladhi Biyadihil-Mulk.\" This Hadith was reported similarly by more than one from Laith bin Abi Sulaim. Mughirah bin Muslim reported it from Abu Az-Zubair, from Jabir from the Prophet (ﷺ) and it is similar to this. Zuhair reported it and said: \"I said to Abu Az-Zubair: 'Did you hear Jabir mentioning this Hadith?' He said: 'Safwan or Ibn Safwan informed me of it.'\" It is as if Zuhair rejected the idea that this Hadith was from Abu Az-Zubair from Jabir. (Another chain) with similar in meaning. (Another chain) that Tawus said: \"They are seventy good merits more of virtue in it than every Surah in the Qur'an",
