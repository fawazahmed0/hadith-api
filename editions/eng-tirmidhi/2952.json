Some of the people of Hadith have criticized Suhail bin Abi Hazm. [Imam At-Tirmidhi said:] This is how it has been reported from some of the people of knowledge among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ), and others. They were very stern about this - about explaining the Qur'an without knowledge. As for what has been related from Mujãhid, Qatadah and others, among the people of knowledge, that they would interpret the Qur'an, then it should not be thought about them that they would say something about the Qur'an, or interpret it without knowledge, or according to their own intellect. Rather that which proves what we have said has been reported from them, that they would not say something from themselves without knowledge. Husain bin Mahdi Al-Basri narrated to us (he said: AbdurRazzaq narrated to us, from Ma'mar, from Qatadah who said): \"There is no Ayah in the Qur'an except that I have heard something about it.\" Ibn Abi 'Umar narrated to us (he said): \"Sufyan bin 'Uyainah narrated to us, from Al-A'mash who said: 'Mujãhid said: If you recited the recitation of Ibn Mas'ud, you would not need to ask Ibn 'Abbãs about much of what you ask him regarding the Qur'an",
