			"text": "Narrated Al-'Ala bin 'Abdur-Rahman:from his father, from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"Whoever performs a Salat in which he does not recite Umm Al-Qur'an in it, then it is aborted, it is aborted, not complete.\" He Said: \"I said: 'O Abu Hurairah! Sometimes I am behind an Imam.' He said: 'O Ibn Al-Farisi! Then recite it to yourself. For indeed I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying: Allah, the Most High said: \"I have divided the Salat between Myself and My slaves into two halves. Half of it is for Me, and half of it for My slave, and My slave shall have what he asks for. My slave stands and says: All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of All that exists.\" So Allah, Blessed is He and Most High says: \"My slave has expressed his gratitude to Me.\" He says: \"The Merciful, the Beneficent. So he says: \"My slave has praised Me.\" He says: Owner of the Day of Reckoning. He says: \"My slave has glorified Me. And this is for Me, and between Me and My slave is: It is You alone whom we worship and it is You alone from whom we seek aid\" until the end of the Surah \"This is for My slave and My slave shall have what he asks for.\" So he says: Guide us to the straight path. The path of those upon whom You have bestowed your favor, not those with whom is Your wrath, now those who are astray.\"' [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan. (Other chains of narrations) (Another chain) from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet said: \"Whoever performs a Salat in which he does not recite Umm AlQur'an in it, then it is aborted, [it is aborted,] then it is aborted, not complete.\" And in Ismã'il bin Abi Uwais' Hadith there is no more than this. I asked Abu Zur'ah about this Hadith, he said: \"Both of the Hadith are Sahih.\" And he argued this with the narrations of Ibn Abi Uwais from his father from Al-'Ala",

			"text": "(Another chain) from 'Adi bin Hatim who said:\"I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) while he was sitting in the Masjid, the people said: 'This is 'Adi bin Hatim.' And I came without having a treaty nor a writ. When I was brought to him, he took my hand. Prior to that he had said: 'I hope that Allah will place his hand in my hand.'\" He said: \"He stood with me, and a woman and a boy met him and said: 'We have a need from you.' He stood with them, until he was finished dealing with what they wanted. Then he took me by the hand until he brought me to his house. A slave girl brought him a cushion to sit on, and I sat in front of him. He expressed thanks and praise for Allah then said: 'What has caused you to flee from saying La Ilaha Illallah? Do you know of another god other than Him?'\" He said: \"I said: 'No.'\" He said: \"Then he talked for some time, and then said: 'You refuse to say Allahu Akbar because you know that there is something greater than Allah?'\" He said: \"I said: 'No.' He said: 'Indeed the Jews are those who Allah is wrath with, and the Christians have strayed.'\" He said: \"I said: 'Indeed I am a Muslim, Hanif.'\" He said: \"I saw his face smiling with happiness.\" He said: \"Then he ordered that I stop with him at the home of a man from the Ansar, whom he would frequently visit in the mornings and the evenings. When I was with him at night, a people in woolen garments of these Nimar (a cloth with certain patters, and the word appeared before) came. Then he performed Salat and stood to encourage them (the people) to give (charity) to them. Then he said: 'Even with a Sa' or half a Sa', or a handful or part of a handful, to save the face of one of you from the heat of Hell, or the Fire. And even if it be by a date or a part of a date - for indeed one of you shall meet Allah and it shall be said to him what I say to you: \"Have I not given hearing and seeing to you?\" He shall say: \"Of course.\" It will be said: \"Have I not given you wealth and children?\" He shall say: \"Of course.\" It will be said: \"So where is what you have sent forth for yourself?\" He will look before him and behind him, on his right and on his left, but he shall not find anything to protect his face from the heat of Hell. Let one of you protect his face from the Fire, even if with part of a date, and if he does not find that, then with a good statement. For indeed I do not fear poverty for you - Allah will aid you and grant you, such that a woman can travel on her camel howda from Yathrib to Al-Hirah, or further, without fear of being robbed.' I began thinking to myself: \"Where would the thieves of Taiy' be then?",
