The Prophet (ﷺ) was asked about that, so Allah, Blessed and Most High, revealed: \"They ask you about menstruation. Say It is a Adha (harmful matter) (2:222).' So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) told them to eat with them, drink with them and to remain in the house with them, and to do everything besides intercourse with them. The Jews said: 'He does not want to leave any matter of ours without opposing us in it.'\" He said: \"Then 'Abbad bin Bishr and Usaid bin Hudair came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to inform him about that. They said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Should we not (then) have intercourse with them during their menstruation?' The face of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) changed color, until they thought that he was angry with them. So they left, and afterwards the Prophet (ﷺ) was given some milk as a gift, so he sent some of it to them to drink. Then they knew that he was not angry with them","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":29}}]}
