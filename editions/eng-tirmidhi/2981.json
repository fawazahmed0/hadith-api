			"text": "Narrated Al-Hasan:from Ma'qil bin Yasar that he married his sister to a man among the Muslims during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She remained with him as long as she did, then he divorced her once without taking her back until her 'Iddah elapsed, but they desired each other again. He (Ma'qil) said to him: 'You ingrate! I honored you by marrying her to you, then you divorced her. By Allah! She will never be returned to you again.' Allah knew of his heed for her and her need for a husband, so Allah, Blessed and Most High, revealed: 'And when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed period...' up to His saying: '... and you do not know (2:232).' So when Ma'qil heard that he said: 'I heard my Lord and obey.' Then he called for him and said: 'I marry you, and honor you.'\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. It has been reported through other routes from AlHasan, and that is reported from Hasan is Gharib. And in this Hadtth, there is proof that marriage is not allowed without a Wali, because Ma'qil bin Yasãr's sister was not a virgin, so if the matter was up to her, not her Wali, then she could have married herself, and she would have had no need for Ma'qil bin Yasãr to act as the Wali for her. And Allah only addressed the Wali in this Ayah, saying: Do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands. - so in this Ayah is the evidence that the authority is with the Wali in marrying (women) with their consent",
