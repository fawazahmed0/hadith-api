			"text": "Narrated Abu Hurairah:that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"O you people! Indeed Allah is Tayyib (good) and he does not accept but what is good. And indeed Allah ordered the believers with what He ordered the Messengers. He (ﷺ) said: 'O you Messengers! Eat of the good things and do righteous deeds. Verily I am well acquainted with what you do (23:51).' And He said: 'O you who believe! Eat from the good things We have provided you (2:172).' He said: \"And he mentioned a man: 'Who is undertaking a long journey, whose hair is dishevelled and he is covered with dust. He raises his hands to the heavens and says: \"O Lord! O Lord!\" Yet his food is from the unlawful, his drink is from the unlawful, his clothing is from the unlawful, and he was nourished by the unlawful. So how can that be accepted?",
