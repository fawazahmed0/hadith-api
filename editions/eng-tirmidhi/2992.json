			"text": "Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:\"When this Ayah was revealed: And whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it (2:284). Somethings entered their hearts that had not entered before. So they mentioned that to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said: 'Say: \"We hear and we obey.\" So Allah put faith into their hearts and Allah Blessed and Most High revealed the Ayah: The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers (and) Allah does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear, for it is what it has earned and against it is what it has wrought. \"Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error (2:286).\" He said: 'I have done so (as requested).' Our Lord! Lay not upon us a burden like that which You did upon those before us. He said: ['I have done so (as requested).'] Our Lord! Put not a burden upon us greater than we have strength for. Pardon us and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us (2:286). He said: 'I have done so (as requested)",
