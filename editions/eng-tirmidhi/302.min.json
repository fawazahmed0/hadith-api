Then what appeared to be a Bedouin man entered to pray, but he performed his Salat in a very brief manner. He then got up and greeted the prophet with Salam. The Prophet said (returning the greeting): 'And upon you. Go back and perform Salat, for indeed you have no prayed.' So he returned to perform Salat then came and greeted the Prophet with Salam. So he (the Prophet) said (returning the greeting): 'And upon you. Go back and perform Salat, for indeed you have not prayed.' [He did that] two or three times, each time coming to the Prophet, greeted the Prophet with Salam and the Prophet saying: 'And upon you. Go back and perform Salat, for indeed you have not prayed.' - until the people got scared and became very worried that one whose prayer was so brief had not actually prayed. Then in the end the man said: 'Then show me, and teach me, for I am a human who has suffered and is mistaken.' So he said: 'Alright. When you stand for Salat then perform Wudu as Allah ordered you. Then say the Tashahhud, and the Iqamah as well. If you know any Quran then recite it, if not then praise Allah, mention His greatness, and the Tahlil. Then bow such that you are at rest in your bowing, then stand completely, then prostrate completely, then sit such that you are at rest while sitting them stand. When you have done that, then you have completed your Salat, and if you leave out something, then you have made your Salat deficient.' And this was easier on them than the first matter, because if some of this was deficient, It would only reduce the reward of his Salat, it would not have gone entirely","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":2,"hadith":154}}]}
