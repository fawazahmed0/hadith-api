			"text": "Narrated Miqsam, the freed slave of 'Abdullah bin Al-Harith:from Ibn 'Abbas that he said the Ayah: Not equal are those of the believers who sit, except those who are disabled... (4:95) is about Badr and those went out for Badr. At the time of the battle of Badr, 'Abdullah bin Jahsh and Ibn Umm Maktum said: 'We are blind O Messenger of Allah! So is there an exemption for us?' So the following was revealed: Not equal are those of the believers who sit except those who are disabled. But Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward (4:95). So these were the people who sat behind, that were not disabled: But Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward - they are of levels above those who sit among the believers who did not have an excuse",
