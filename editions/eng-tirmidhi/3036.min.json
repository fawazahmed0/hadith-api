Bushair was a hypocrite who would recite poetry reviling the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) then he would attribute it to some of the Arabs. Then he would say: 'So-and-so said this and that [So-and-so said this and that].' So when the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) would hear that poetry, they would say: 'By Allah! No one but this filthy person said this poetry - or as the man said - and they would say: 'Ibn Al-Ubairiq said it.'\" He said: \"They were a poor and needy household during Jahiliyyah and Islam. The only food the people of Al-Madinah had was dates and barely. When a man was able to, he would import flour from Ash-Sham which he bought and kept for himself. As for his dependants, their only food was dates and barely. So an import arrived from Ash-Sham, and my uncle Rifa'ah bin Zaid bought a load of it, which he put in a storage area he had, where he kept his weapons - his shield and his sword. But it was taken from him from under the house. The storage was broken into and and the food and weapons were taken. In the morning, my uncle Rifa'ah came to me and said: 'O my nephew! We were robbed during the night, our storage was broken into, and our food and weapons are gone.'\" He said: \"They overheard us in the house, and questioned us, and someone said to us, 'We saw Banu Ubairiq cooking during the night, and it looked like they had some of your food.'\" He said: \"Banu Ubairiq were saying - while we were questioning them amidst their dwellings - 'By Allah! We do not think the one you are looking for is other than Labid bin Sahl, a man among us who is righteous and accepted Islam.' When Labid heard that, he brandished his sword and said: 'I stole? By Allah! You either prove this theft, or I take to you with this sword.' They said: 'Leave us O man! You are not the one who has it.' So we continued questioning in the dwellings until we had no doubt that they had taken it. So my uncle said to me: 'O my nephew! You should go to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and tell him about that.'\" Qatadah said: \"So I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: 'A family among us are ill-mannered, and they conspired against my uncle Rifa'ah bin aid. They broken into his storage and took his weapons and his food. We want them to return our weapons, but we have no need for the food.' So the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'I will decide about that.' So when Banu Ubairiq heard about that, they brought a man from among them named Usair bin 'Urwah to talk to him about that, and some people form their houses gathered and said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Qatadah bin An-Nu'man and his uncle came came to a family among us who are a people of Islam and righteousness, accusing them of stealing without proof or confirmation.'\" Qatadah said: \"I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and spoke to him, and he said: 'You went to a family among them known for their Islam and righteousness, and accused them of stealing without confirmation or proof.'\" He said: \"So I returned wishing that I had lost some of my wealth, and that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had not been spoke to about that. My uncle Rifa'ah came to me and said: 'O my nephew! What did you do?' So I told him what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me, so he said: 'It is from Allah, Whom we seek help.' It was not long before the Qur'an was revealed: 'Surely, We have sent down to you the Book in truth, that you might judge between men by that which Allah has shown you, so be not a pelader for the treacherous.' That is Banu Ubairiq. 'And seek forgiveness from Allah.' [That is] from what you said to Qatadah. 'Certainly Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And argue not on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Verily, Allah does not like anyone who is a betrayer, sinner. They may hide from men, but they cannot hide from Allah for He is with them up to His saying: 'Most Merciful.' That is: If you seek Allah's forgiveness then He will forgive you. 'And whoever earns sin, he earns it only against himself...' up to His saying: 'A manifest sin.' Their saying about Labid; 'Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His Mercy upon you...' up to His saying: 'We shall give him a great reward.' (4:105-115)\" So when the Qur'an was revealed, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) brought the weapon and returned it to Rifa'ah. Qatadah said: \"When the weapon was brought to my uncle - and he was an elderly man with bad sight\" or \"an elderly weak man\" - Abu 'Eisa was in doubt - \"in Jahiliyyah, and I thought that he merely had entered into Islam (without real sincerity) but when I brought it to him, he said: 'O my nephew! It is for Allah's cause.' So I knew that his Islam was genuine. When the Qur'an was revealed, Bushair went with the idolaters, staying with Sulafah bint Sa'd bin Sumayyah. So Allah, Most High, revealed: Whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers' way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell - what an evil destination. Verily Allah forgives not associating others with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whomever He wills. And whoever associates others with Allah, then he has indeed strayed away (4:115-116). \"When he went to stay with Sulafah, Hassan bin Thabit lampooned her with verses of poetry. So she took his saddle, put it on her head, then she left with it to cast into the valley. Then she said: 'You gave me the poetry of Hassan - you did not bring me any good","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":88}}]}
