So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'O Abu Bakr! Shall I recite to you an Ayah revealed to me?' I said: 'Of course O Messenger of Allah!' So he recited it to me, and I do not know except that I found it as a fatal blow, but I repressed it. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'What is bothering you O Abu Bakr?' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah! May my father and my mother be your ransom! Which of us has not done evil - and yet we shall be recompensed for what we have done?'
