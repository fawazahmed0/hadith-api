When they arrived with what he left behind, they searched for a bowl made of silver which was inlaid with gold. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had the two of them take an oath. Then they found the bowl in Makkah, and the person said: 'We purchased it from Tamim and 'Adi.' So two men among the relatives of the Sahmi man stood to take an oath by Allah that they (his family) had more right to it than them.\" He said: \"So it was about them that the following was revealed: O you who believe! (When death approaches any of you then) take the testimony (5:106)",
