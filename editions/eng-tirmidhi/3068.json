			"text": "Narrated Masruq:\"I was reclining in the presence of 'Aishah when she said: 'O Abu 'Aishah! There are three things, whoever speaks of one of them, then he has uttered one of the worst lies against Allah. Whoever claims that Muhammad saw his Lord. Then he has uttered one the worst lies against Allah, Allah says: No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision, and He is the Most Subtle, Well-Acquainted with all things (6:103). It is not for any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation or from behind a veil (42:51).' I was reclining so I sat up an said: 'O Mother of the Believers! Take your time with me and do not be hasty with me! Did Allah Most High not say: And indeed he saw him at a second descent (53:13). (And) 'And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon (81:23).' She said 'By Allah! I was the first who asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about this. He said: \"That was only Jibril. I did not see him in the appearance he was created in except for these two times. I saw him descending from the heavens, and due to his tremendous size he filled what was between the heavens and the earth.\" \"And whoever claimed that Muhammad hid anything that Allah revealed to him, then he uttered one of the worst lies against Allah. Allah says: O Messenger! Proclaim what has been sent down to you from your Lord (5:67).\" \"And whoever claimed that he (ﷺ) knew what would be tomorrow, then he has uttered one of the worst lies against Allah. Allah says: Say: 'None in the heavens and in the earth knows the unseen but Allah (27:65)",
