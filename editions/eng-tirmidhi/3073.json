If he acts upon it then write ten of the same for him. And when he considers doing something evil, then do not write it. If he acts upon it, then write it. If he leaves it\" - and perhaps he said: \"if he does not act upon it, then write a good reward for him.'\" Then he [the Prophet (ﷺ)] recited: Whoever comes with a good, then he shall have ten the like thereof (6:160)",
