He said: 'I was sent with four: That there shall be no Tawaf around the House while naked, that if there is a treaty between someone and the Prophet (ﷺ), then the treaty remains until its expiration, and whoever does not have a treaty, then he has the span of four months, none shall enter Paradise except a believer, and the idolaters and Muslims shall not congregate (for Hajj) after this year.'\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. It is the narration of [Sufyan] bin 'Uyainah from Abu Ishaq. Sufyan Ath-Thawri reported it from Abu Ishaq, from some of his companions, from 'Ali, and there is something about it from Abü Hurairah. (Another chain) from Zaid bin Yuthai' from 'Ali with similar wordings. (Another chain) Zaid bin Uthal' from 'Ali with similar wordings. [Abu 'Eisa said:] Both narrations have been reported from Ibn 'Uyainah; from Ibn Uthai' and from Ibn Yuthai'. What is correct is that he is Zaid bin Yuthai'. Shu'bah reported a different narration from Abu Ishaq [from Zaid], and he was mistaken in it, he said: \"From Zaid bin Uthail\" and no one corroborated him in that. [There is something on this topic from Abu Hurairah]","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":144}}]}
