(12:50)' He said: \"May Allah have mercy upon Lut, certainly he used to lean toward powerful support, since he said: \"Would that I had strength to overpower you, or that I could betake myself to some powerful support (11:80).\" So Allah did not send a Prophet after him except among a high ranking family (Dhirwah) among his people.\" (Another chain) except that he said: \"Allah did not send a Prophet after him except among a wealthy family (Tharwah) among his people.\" Muhammad bin 'Amr said: \"Ath-Tharwah is riches and power.
