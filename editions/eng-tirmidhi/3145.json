When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would raise his voice with the Qur'an, the idolaters would insult him, the One Who revealed it, and the one who came with it. So Allah revealed: And offer your Salat neither aloud so that they would not insult the Qur'an and the One who revealed it, and the one who came with it, nor in a low voice (too low) such that you can let your Companions hear it, and learn it from you",
