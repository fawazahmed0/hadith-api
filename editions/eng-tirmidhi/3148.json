			"text": "Narrated Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri:that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"I am the chief of the children of Adam on the Day of Judgement and I am not boasting, and in my hand is the banner of praise and I am not boasting, and there has been no Prophet since Adam or other than him, except that he is under my banner. And I am the first for whom the earth will split open, and I am not boasting.\" He said: \"The people will be frightened by three frights. So they will come to Adam saying: 'You are our father Adam, so intercede for us with your Lord.' So he says: 'I committed a sin for which I was expelled to the earth, so go to Nuh.' So they will come to Nuh and he will say: 'I supplicated against the people of the earth, so they were destroyed. So go to Ibrahim.' So they will go to Ibrahim, and he says: 'I lied three times.'\" Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"He did not lie except defending Allah's religion.\" \"So go to Musa.' So they will come to Musa, and he will say: 'I took a life. So go to 'Eisa. So they go to 'Eisa and he says: 'I was worshiped besides Allah. So go to Muhammad (ﷺ).'\" He said: \"So they will come to me, and I will go to them.\" (One of the narrators) Ibn Ju'dan said: \"Anas said: 'It is as if I am looking at the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he is saying: \"So I will take hold of a ring of a gate of Paradise to rattle it, and it will be said: 'Who is there?' It will be said: 'Muhammad.' They will open it for me, and welcome me saying, 'Welcome.' I will fall prostrate and Allah will inspire me with statements of gratitude and praise and it will be said to me: 'Raise your head, ask and you shall be given, intercede, and your intercession shall be accepted, speak, and your saying shall be heard.' And that is Al-Maqam Al-Mahmud about which Allah said: It may be that your Lord will raise you to Maqaman-Mahmud (17:79).\" Sufyan said: \"None of it is from Anas except this sentence: 'I will take hold of a ring of a gate of Paradise to rattle it",
