So he makes this exception.\" He said: \"So they return, and find it just as it was when they left it. Then they penetrate it, and [they (Ya'juj & Ma'juj)] are released upon the people drinking up the water, and the people flee from them. They shoot their arrows into the heavens so they returned dyed with blood, and they say - crudely and arrogantly - 'We vanquished those in the earth, let us dominate the inhabitants of the heavens.' Then Allah sends Naghaf upon them, attaching to the nape of their necks, destroying them.\" He said: \"By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad!
