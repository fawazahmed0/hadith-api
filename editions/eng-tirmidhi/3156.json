It will be said: 'O people of Paradise! They will raise up their necks to look. It will be said: 'O people of the Fire! And they will raise up their necks to look. It will be said: 'Do you recognize this?' They will say: 'Yes. This is death.' Then it will be laid down and slaughtered. If it were not that Allah had decreed that the inhabitants of Paradise would remain, then they would die of joy, and if it were not that Allah had decreed that the inhabitants of the Fire would remain, then they would die of grief",
