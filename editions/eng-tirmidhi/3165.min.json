I have two slaves who lie to me, deceive me, and disobey me, and I scold them and hit them. So what is my case because of them?\" He said: \"The extent to which they betrayed you, disobeyed you and lied to you will be measured against how much you punish them. If your punishing them is equal to their sins, then the two will be the same, nothing for you and nothing against you. If your punishing them is above their sin, some of your rewards will be taken from you and given to them.\" So the man left, and began weeping and crying aloud. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"You should read what Allah said in His Book: 'And We shall set up the Balances of justice on the Day of Resurrection, then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything...' to the rest of the Ayah (21:47). So the man said: \"By Allah, O Messenger of Allah! I see nothing better for myself, than me parting with them.
