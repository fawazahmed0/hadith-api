			"text": "Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:\"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood to deliver a Khutbah, he said: 'O you people! You will be gathered before Allah naked and uncircumcised.' Then he recited: 'As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it...' until the end of the Ayah (21:104). He said: 'The first to be clothed on the Day of Resurrection is Ibrahim. Indeed some men from my Ummah will be brought and taken from the left side, so I will say: \"My Lord! My followers!\" It will be said: \"Indeed you do not know what they innovated after you.' So I shall say as the righteous slave said: 'And I was a witness over them while I dwelt among them, but when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them. If You punish them, they are your slaves, and if You forgive them...' [until the end of] the Ayah (5:117 & 118) I shall be told: 'These people have not ceased turning on their heels as apostates ever since you parted from them",
