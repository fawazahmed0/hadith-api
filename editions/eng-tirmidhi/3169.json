			"text": "Narrated 'Imran bin Husain:\"We were with the Prophet (ﷺ) on a journey when some of his Companions fell behind. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raised his voice reciting these two Ayat: \"O mankind! Have Taqwa of your Lord! Verily the earthquake of the hour is a terrible thing...\" up to His saying: but Allah's torment is severe (21:1 & 2).\" When his Companions heard that, they hastened to catch up with him, since they knew that he had something to say. He (ﷺ) said: 'Do you know what Day this is? That is the Day when Adam will be called. His Lord will call him and say: O Adam, send forth those who are to be sent to the Fire. He will say: O Lord! How many are to be sent to the Fire? He will say: From every one-thousand there are nine-hundred and ninety-nine for the Fire and one for Paradise. So the people despaired as if they would not smile again. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw the state of his Companions, he said: 'Strive hard and receive the good news. By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, you will be counted with two creations who are immense in numbers; Ya'juj and Ma'juj, and those who have died among the progeny of Adam and the progeny of Iblis.'\" He said: \"So some of the people's grief went away, and he (ﷺ) said: 'Strive hard and receive the good news. By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad! Among mankind, you are but like the mole on the flank of a camel, or a mark on the foreleg of a beast",
