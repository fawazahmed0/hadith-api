Bashir bin Sa'd said: 'Allah ordered us to say Salat upon you, so how do we say Salat upon you?'\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was silent, until we thought that we had not even asked him. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Say: O Allah! Send Salat upon Muhammad and upon Muhammad's family just as you have sent [upon Ibrahim and] upon Ibrahim's family. And bless Muhammad and Muhammad's family just as you have blessed [Ibrahim and] Ibrahim's family among the nations. Indeed you are praised, the glorious.' And the Salam is as you have learned",
