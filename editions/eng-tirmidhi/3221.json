			"text": "Narrated Abu Hurairah:that the Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"Verily Musa, peace be upon him, was a shy and modest man, who would never show anything of his skin out of modesty. Some of the Children of Isra'il annoyed him by saying: 'He only keeps himself covered because of some defect in his skin, either leprosy, a scrotal hernia or some other defect.' Allah [the Mighty and Sublime] wanted to free Musa from what they were saying about him. One day Musa, [peace be upon him], was alone. He took off his garment, and put it on a rock, then he took a bath. When he had finished, he turned back to pick up his garment, but the rock moved away, taking his garment with it. Musa picked up his staff, and chased the rock saying: 'My garment, O you rock! My garment, O you rock!' Until he reached a group of the Children of Isra'il who saw him naked, and discovered that he was the best of those whom Allah had created.\" He said: \"The rock stood still, he took his garment and put it on. He started striking the rock with his staff, and by Allah, the marks of that beating were left on the rock; three, four, or five. This is what is referred to in the Ayah: ' O you who believe! Be not like those who annoyed Musa, but Allah freed him from what they had alleged, and he was honourable before Allah (33:69)",
