Shall I not fight those who turn away among my people, along with those who believe? So he permitted me to fight them and made me their commander.' When I left him, he asked me, saying: 'What has Al-Ghutaifi done?' He was informed that I set off on my journey.\" He said: \"So he sent a message on my route that I should return. I went to him and he was with a group of his Companions. He said: 'Invite your people. Whoever accepts Islam among them then accept it from him. And whoever does not accept Islam, then do not be hasty until new news reaches you.'\" He said: \"And what was revealed about Saba was revealed, so a man said: 'O Messenger of Allah! What is Saba; is it a land or a woman?' He said: 'It is neither a land nor a woman, but it is a man who had ten sons among the Arabs. Six of them went south (in Yemen) and four of them went north (toward Ash-Sham). As for those who went north, they are Lakhm, Judham, Ghassan and 'Amilah. As for those who sent south, they are Azad, Al-'Ash'ariyyun, Himyar, Kindah, Madhhij, and Anmar.' A man said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Who are Anmar?' He said: 'Those among whom are Khath'am and Bajilah.'\" [This Hadith has been related from Ibn 'Abbas from the Prophet (ﷺ]","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":274}}]}
