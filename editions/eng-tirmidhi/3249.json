Their bellies were fat, and they did not have much understanding. They said something that I could not understand, then one of them said: 'Do you think that Allah can hear what we are talking about?' Another said: 'If we raise our voices, He will hear it, but if we do not raise our voices, He will not hear it.' The other one said: 'If He can hear something from us, then He can hear all of it.'\" 'Abdullah said: \"I mentioned that to the Prophet (ﷺ), so Allah revealed: 'And you have not been hiding yourselves, lest your ears and your eyes and your skin should testify against you...' up to His saying: '...and you have become of those utterly lost!
