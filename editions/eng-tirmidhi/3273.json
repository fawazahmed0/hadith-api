			"text": "Narrated Abu Wa'il:from a man of Rabi'ah who said: \"I arrived in Al-Madinah, entered upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and mentioned the emissary of 'Ad to him. I said: 'I seek refuge in Allah from being like the emissary of 'Ad.' So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'And what of the emissary of 'Ad?'\" He said: \"I said: You have got the one who is informed about it. When 'Ad suffered from famine they sent Qail and he stayed with Bakr bin Mu'awiyah. He gave him wine to drink and two slave girls to sing for him. Then he went out towards the mountains of Murrah and said: \"O Allah! I did not come to You to cure a sick person, nor to ransom a captive! So give water to Your slave as You used to do, and give water to Bakr bin Mu'awiyah along with him.\" He said that out of gratitude for the wine which he gave him to drink. So two clouds appeared and it was said to him: \"Choose one of them.\" So he chose the black one. It was said to him: \"Take it as ashes that will leave none in 'Ad.\" So he mentioned that the wind sent upon them was not more than this circle - meaning the circle of a ring - then he recited: \"...We sent against them the barren wind; it spared nothing that it reached, but blew it into broken spreads of rotten ruins.
