So Ibn 'Abbas (finally) said: 'We are Banu Hashim.' So Ka'b said: 'Indeed Allah divided His being seen and His speaking between Muhammad and Musa. He spoke to Musa two times, and Muhammad saw Him two times.' Masruq said: 'I entered upon 'Aishah and asked her if Muhammad saw his Lord.' She said: 'You have said something that makes my hair stand on end.' I said: 'Take it easy.' Then I recited: Indeed he saw of the great signs of his Lord (53:18).

Rather he (ﷺ) saw Jibra'il, but he did not see him in his (real) image except two times.
