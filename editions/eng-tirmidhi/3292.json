And in Paradise there is a tree under whose shade a rider can travel for one hundred years without stopping. Recite if you wish: And in shade extended. And the space occupied by a whip in Paradise is better than the world and whatever is in it. Recite if you wish: And whoever is removed away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he indeed is successful. The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception.”",
