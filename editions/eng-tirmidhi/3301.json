The Prophet of Allah said: “Do you know what this person said?” They said: “Allah and His Messenger know better – he said the Salam – O Allah’s Prophet.” He said: “No, rather he said like this and that. Bring him back for e=me.” So they brought him back and he said: “Did you say As-Samu Alaikum? He said: “Yes.” So with that Allah’s Prophet said: “When one of the People of the Book gives you the Salam, then say: “Alaika Ma Qulta (Whatever you said to you too).” He said: ‘And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not.’",
