Verily Banu so-and-so comforted me in the case of my uncle, and I must reciprocate for them.’ But he refused to allow me. So I asked him again numerous times, then he permitted me to reciprocate for them. So after reciprocating for the, I did not wail for anyone else until this time. And there does not remain a woman except that she has wailed besides me.’”",
