So we all rushed toward some water and the Bedouins raced us to it. One of the Bedouins beat his companions to it and he (tried to obstruct) the pond, he placed rocks around it and he put a leather sheet over it until his companions came.” He said: “A man among the Ansar reached the Bedouin and he dropped the reigns of his camel to drink, but the Bedouin would not allow him. So he started removing the barriers around the water, but the Bedouin raised a stick beating the Ansari man on the head, and smashed it. He went to Abdullah bin Ubayy, the head of the hypocrite, to inform him – he was in fact one of his companions. So Abdullah bin Ubayy became enraged, the he said: ‘Do not spend anything on whoever is with Muhammad until they depart.’ Meaning the Bedouins. They were preparing food for the Messenger of Allah. So Abdullah said: ‘When they depart from Muhammad, then bring Muhammad some food, and let him and whoever is with him eat it.’ Then he said to his companions: ‘If we return to Al-Madinah, indeed the more honorable will expel therefrom the meaner.’” Zaid said: “And I was riding behind the Messenger of Allah, and I had heard Abdullah bin Ubayy, so I informed my uncle who went to tell the Messenger of Allah. He sent a message to him (Abdullah) but he took an oath and denied it.” He said: “So the Messenger of Allah accepted what he said and did not believe me. So my uncle came to me and said: ‘You only wanted the Messenger of Allah to hate you, and the Muslims to say that you lied.’” He said: “I suffered such worry as has not been suffered by anyone else.” He said: “(Later) while I was on the move with the Messenger of Allah on a journey, my mind was relieved of worry, since the Messenger of Allah came to me and rubbed my ear and smiled in my face. I would never be happier than with that as long as the world remained. Then Abu Bakr caught up to me, and said: ‘What did the Messenger of Allah say to you?’ I said: ‘He did not say anything to me, he only rubbed my ear and smiled in my face.’ He said: ‘Receive the good news!’ Then Umar caught up with me and I said the same to him as I had said to Abu Bakr. In the morning the Messenger of Allah recited Surat Al-Munafiqin.”","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih Isnaad"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih Isnaad"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":365}}]}
