			"text": "Al-Hakam bin Utaibah said:“I heard Muhammad bin Ka’b Al-Qurazi – forty years ago – narrating from Zaid bin Arqam [may Allah be pleased with him] that during the battle of Tabuk, Abdullah bin Ubayy said: “If we return to Al-Madinah, indeed the more honorable will expel therefrom the meaner.” He said: ‘So I went to the Prophet and mentioned that to him, but he (Abdullah) took an oath that he did not say it. My people blamed me for that, they said: “What did you expect to accomplish from this?’ So I went to my house and slept full of grief. Then the Prophet came to me’ or ‘I went to him, and he said: “Indeed Allah has verified the truth of what you said.” He said: ‘So this Ayah was revealed: there are the ones who say: “Do not spend on those who are with the Messenger of Allah until they desert from him.”",
