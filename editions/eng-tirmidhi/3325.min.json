So I raised my head, and there was an angel, the one that had come to me at Hira, sitting upon a chair between the heavens and the earth. I fled from him out of fear, and I returned and said: ‘Wrap me up! Wrap me up! So they covered me.” Then Allah, Most High revealed: ‘O you who are wrapped up! Arise and warm.’ Up to His saying: ‘And keep away from the Rujz!’ before the Salat was made obligatory.”","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":377}}]}
