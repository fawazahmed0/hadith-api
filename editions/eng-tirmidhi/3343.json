He said: ‘When their most wicked went forth.’ A strong and mighty man who was invincible among his tribe, like Zam’ah, went forth for her.’ Then I heard him mentioning the women, so he said: ‘One of you should not lash his wife as a slave is lashed, for perhaps he will lay with her at the end of the day.’” He said: “Then he advised against laughing when passing gas, he said: ‘One of you should not laugh at what he himself does.’”",
