That distressed him, so (the following) was revealed: Verily We have granted you Al-Kauthar (O Muhammad) meaning a river in Paradise, and (the following) was revealed: ‘Verily We have sent it down on the Night of Al-Qadr. And what will make you know what the Night of Al-Qadr is? The Night of Al-Qadr is better than a thousand months, in which Banu Umayyah rules after you O Muhammad.” Al-Qasim said: “So we counted them, and found that they were one-thousand months, not a day more nor less.”","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":402}}]}
