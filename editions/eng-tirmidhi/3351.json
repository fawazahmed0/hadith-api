He knows that is during the last ten (nights) of Ramadan, and that it is the night of the twenty-seventh. But he wanted the people to not rely upon that.’ Then he uttered an oath, that without exception it is on the night of the twenty-seventh.” He said: “I said to him: ‘Why is it that you say that O Abu Al-Mindhir?’ He said: “By the sign or indication which the Messenger of Allah informed us of: ‘That the sun rises on that day having no beams with it.’”",
