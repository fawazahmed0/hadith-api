And all praise belongs to Allah. None has the right to be worshiped but Allah, alone, without partner. (Amsaina wa amsal-mulku lillāh, wal-ḥamdullilāh, wa lā ilāha illallāh, waḥdahu lā sharīka lahu)’ – I think he said [in it]: - ‘To Him belongs the Dominion, and to Him is the praise, and He is capable of all things. I ask You for the good that is in this night, and the good of what is after it, and I seek refuge in You from the evil of this night, and the evil of what is after it, and I seek refuge in You from laziness and helpless old age. And I seek refuge in You from the punishment of the Fire and the punishment of the grave (Lahul-mulku wa lahul-ḥamdu, wa huwa `alā kulli shai'in qadīr. Asa'luka khaira mā fī hādhihil-lailah, wa khaira mā ba`dahā, wa a`ūdhu bika min sharri hādhihil-lailati wa sharri mā ba`dahā, wa a`ūdhu bika minal-kasali wa sū'il-kibar, wa a`ūdhu bika min `adhābin-nāri wa `adhābil-qabr).’ And when he reached the morning, he (ﷺ) used to say, ‘We have reached the morning, and the Dominion has reached the morning, while belonging to Allah. And all praise belongs to Allah (Aṣbaḥnā wa aṣbaḥal-mulku lillāh, wal-ḥamdulillāh).’”","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":48,"hadith":21}}]}
