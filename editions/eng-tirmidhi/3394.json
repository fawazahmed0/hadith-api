You say: ‘O Allah, verily, I submit myself to You, and I turn my face to You, and I entrust my affair to You, hoping in You and fearing in You. And I lay myself down depending upon You, there is no refuge [nor escape] from You except to You. I believe in Your Book which You have revealed, and in Your Prophet whom You have sent (Allāhumma innī aslamtu nafsī ilaika wa wajjahtu wajhī ilaika, wa fawwaḍtu amrī ilaika, raghbatan wa rahbatan ilaika wa alja'tu ẓahrī ilaika, lā malja'a [wa lā manjā] minka illā ilaik. Āmantu bikitābikal-ladhī anzalta wa binabiyyikal-ladhī arsalt).’” Al-Bara' said: “So I said: ‘And in Your Messenger whom you have sent.’” He said: “So he (ﷺ) struck his hand upon my chest, then said: “And in Your Prophet whom You have sent. (Wa binabiyyikal-ladhī arsalt).”",
