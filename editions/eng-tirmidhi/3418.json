So forgive me what I have done before and after, and that which I have hidden and that which I have done openly. You are my Deity, no has the right to be worshiped but You (Allāhumma lakal-ḥamd, anta nūrus-samāwāti wal-arḍ, wa lakal-ḥamd, anta qayyāmus-samāwāti wal-arḍ, wa lakal-ḥamd, anta rabbus-samāwāti wal-arḍ, wa man fīhinn, antal-ḥaqq, wa wa`dukal-ḥaqq, wa liqā'uka ḥaqq, wal-jannatu ḥaqq, wan-nāru ḥaqq, was-sā`atu ḥaqq. Allāhumma laka aslamtu, wa bika āmantu, wa `alaika tawakkaltu, wa ilaika anabtu, wa bika khāṣamtu, wa ilaika ḥākamtu, faghfirlī mā qaddamtu wa mā akhartu, wa mā asrartu wa mā a`lant.
