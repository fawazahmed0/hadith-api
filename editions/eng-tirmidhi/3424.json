I had a dream at night while I was sleeping, in which I was praying behind a tree, when I prostrated, the tree prostrated along with me. Then I heard it saying: “O Allah! Record for me a reward with You for it, remove a sin from me by it, and store it away for me with You for it, and accept it from me as You accepted it from Your worshipper Dawud (Allāhumma uktub lī bihā `indaka ajran, waḍa` `annī bihā wizran, waj`alhā lī `indaka dhukhran, wa taqabbalhā minnī kamā taqabbalta min `abdika Dāwūd).” Al-Hasan said: “Ibn Juraij said to me: ‘Your grandfather said to me: “Ibn Abbas said: ‘So the Prophet recited (an Ayah of) prostration, then prostrated.’” [He said] “So Ibn Abbas said: ‘I listened to him, and he was saying the same as the man informed that the tree had said.’”",
