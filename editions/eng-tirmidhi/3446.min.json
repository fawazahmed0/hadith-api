When he placed his foot in the stirrup he said: ‘In the Name of Allah,’ (Bismillāh) [three times]. So then, once he had ascended upon its back, he said: ‘All praise is due to Allah.’ (Al-ḥamdulillāh) then he said: Glory is to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we were not able to do it. And, surely, to our Lord are we returning (Subḥān alladhī sakh-khara lanā hādhā wa mā kunnā lahū muqrinīn. Wa innā ilā rabbinā lamunqalibūn). Then he said: ‘All praise is due to Allah (Al-ḥamdulillāh)’ – three times – and ‘Allah is the Greatest (Allāhu Akbar)’ – three times – ‘Glory is to You, indeed I have wronged myself, so forgive me, for indeed none forgives sins except You (Subḥānaka innī qad ẓalamtu nafsī faghfirlī fa-innahū lā yaghfirudh-dhunūba illā ant).’ Then he laughed. So I said: ‘O Commander of the Believer! What caused you to laugh?’ He said: ‘I saw the Messenger of Allah do as I did, then he (ﷺ) laughed, so I said, ‘What cause you to laugh?’ He said: ‘Indeed, your Lord is very pleased with His worshipper when he says: “O my Lord, forgive me my sins, indeed, no one other than You forgives sins.”","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":48,"hadith":77}}]}
