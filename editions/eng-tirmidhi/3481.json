So he (ﷺ) said to her: “Say: ‘O Allah, Lord of the Seven Heavens and the Lord of the Magnificent Throne, our Lord, and the Lord of everything, Revealer of the Tawrah, the Injil, and the Quran, Splitter of the seed-grain and the date-stone, I seek refuge in You from the evil of everything that You are holding by the forelock, You are the First, for there is nothing above You, and You are the Last, for there is nothing after you. And you are az-Zahir, for there is nothing above you. And you are Al-Batin, for there is nothing below You. Relieve me from debt, and enrich me from poverty (Allāhumma rabbas samāwātis-sab`i wa rabbal-`arshil-`aẓīm, rabbana, wa rabba kulli shai’in, munzilat-Tawrāti wal-Injīli wal-Qur’ān, fāliqal-habbi wan-nawā, a`ūdhu bika min sharri kulli shai’in anta ākhidhun bināṣiyatihi, antal-awwalu falaisa qablaka shai’un, wa antal-ākhiru falaisa ba`daka shai’un, wa antaẓ-ẓāhiru falaisa fawqaka shai’un, wa antal-bāṭinu falaisa dūnaka shai’un, iqḍi `anni-daina wa aghnini minal-faqr).”",
