Six in the earth, and one above the heavens.’ He said: ‘So which of them do you take for your ardent requests and fears?’ He said: ‘The one above the heavens.’ He said: ‘O Husain, if you would but accept Islam, I would teach you two phrases that would benefit you.’” He said: “So when Husain accepted Islam, he said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, teach me the two phrases you promised me.’ So he (ﷺ) said: “Say: O Allah, inspire me with my guidance, and protect me from the evil of my soul (Allāhumma alhimnī rushdī, wa a`idhnī min sharri nafsī).’”",
