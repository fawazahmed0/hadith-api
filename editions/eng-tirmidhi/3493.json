So I felt around for him, and my hand fell upon his feet while he was prostrating, and he was saying: ‘I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your anger, and in Your pardon from Your punishment. I cannot count Your praises. You are as You have praised Yourself (A`ūdhu biriḍāka min sakhaṭika wa bi mu`āfātika min `uqūbatika, lā uḥṣi thanā’an `alaika anta kamā athnaita `alā nafsik).’”",
