			"text": "Ali bin Abi Talib said:“The most of what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) supplicated with during the afternoon at Arafat while standing was: ‘O Allah to You is the praise like the one You say, and better than what we say. O Allah, for You is all my Salat, my sacrifice, my living and my dying. And to You is my return, and to You, my Lord, belongs my inheritance. O Allah, indeed, I seek refuge in You from the punishment of the grave, the whispering of the chest, and the dividing of the affair. O Allah, indeed, I seek refuge in You from the evil of what the wind brings (Allāhumma lakal-ḥamdu, kalladhī taqūlu, wa khairan mimmā naqūl. Allāhumma laka ṣalātī wa nusukī, wa maḥyāya wa mamātī, ilaika ma’ābī, wa laka, rabbi, turāthī. Allāhumma innī a`ūdhu bika min `adhābil-qabri, wa waswasatiṣ-ṣadri, wa shatātil-amr. Allāhumma innī a`ūdhu bika min sharri mā tajī’u bihir-rīḥ).”",
