We said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, you supplicated with many supplications of which we did not preserve a thing.’ He (ﷺ) said: ‘Should I not direct you to what will include all of that? That you say: O Allah, we ask You from the good of what Your Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) asked You for, and we seek refuge in You from the evil of that which Your Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) sought refuge in You from, and You are the one from Whom aid is sought, and it is for You to fulfill, and there is no might or power except by Allah (Allāhumma innā nas’aluka min khairi mā sa’alaka minhu nabiyyuka Muḥammad, ṣallallāhu `alaihi wa sallam, wa na`ūdhu bika min sharri masta`ādha minhu nabiyyuka Muḥammad, ṣallallāhu `alaihi wa sallam, wa antal-musta`ānu wa `alaikal-balāgh, wa lā ḥawla wa lā quwwata illā billāh).’”",
