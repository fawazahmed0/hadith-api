My Lord, make me ever-grateful to You, ever-remembering of You, ever-fearful of You, ever-obedient to You, ever-humble to You, oft-turning and returning to You. My Lord, accept my repentance, wash my sin, answer my call, make firm my proof, make firm my tongue, guide my heart, and remove the treachery of my chest (Rabbi a`innī wa lā tu`in `alayya, wanṣurnī wa lā tanṣur `alayya, wamkur lī wa lā tamkur `alayya, wahdinī wa yassiril-huda lī, wanṣurnī `alā man baghā `alayya.
