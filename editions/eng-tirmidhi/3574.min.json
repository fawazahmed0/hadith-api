Then lie on your right side, then say: ‘O Allah, I submit my face to You, and I entrust my affair to You, and I lay myself down relying upon You, hoping in You and fearing You. There is no refuge nor escape from You except to You. I believe in Your Book which You have revealed, and in Your Prophet whom You have sent (Allāhumma aslamtu wajhī ilaika wa fawwaḍtu amrī ilaika, wa alja’tu ẓahrī ilaika, raghbatan wa rahbatan ilaika, lā malja’a wa lā manjā minka illā ilaika, āmantu bikitābikalladhī anzalta wa bi-nabiyykalladhī arsalt).’ And if you die that night, you shall die upon the Fitrah” - Al-Bara’ said: I repeated it to retain it in memory, “So I said: ‘I believe in Your Messenger whom You have sent.’” He said: “So he (ﷺ) struck with his hand upon my chest, then said: ‘And in Your Prophet whom You have sent.’”","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":48,"hadith":205}}]}
