When he completed the Salat he said: \"The Imam is appointed to be followed; when he says the Takbir then say the Takbir, when he bows, then bow, and when he raises his head, then raise your heads. When he says: \"Sami' Allahu liman hamidah (Allah listens to those who praise him)\" then say: \"Rabbana wa lakal-hamd. (O our Lord! And all praise is Yours.)\" and when he prostrates, then prostrate, and when he performs Salat sitting, then pray sitting altogether",
