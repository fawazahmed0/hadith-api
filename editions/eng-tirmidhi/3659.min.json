The Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Are you not amazed at this old man, when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) mentioned a righteous man whose Lord gave him the choice between this life or meeting his Lord, and he chose meeting his Lord.'\" He said: \"But Abu Bakr was the most knowledgeable one of them regarding what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said. So Abu Bakr said: 'Rather we will ransom our fathers and wealth for you.' So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'There is no one among people more beneficial to us (Amanna Ilaina) in his companionship, or generous with his wealth than Ibn Abi Quhafah. And, if I were to take a Khalil, I would have taken Ibn Abi Quhafah as a Khalil.
