I took an oath that if Allah returned you safely, I would beat the Duff before you and sing.' So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to her: 'If you have taken an oath, then beat it, and if you have not then do not.' So she started to beat the Duff, and Abu Bakr entered while she was beating it. Then 'Ali entered while she was beating it, then 'Uthman entered while she was beating it. Then 'Umar entered, so she put the Duff under her, and sat upon it. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Indeed Ash-Shaitan is afraid of you O 'Umar! I was sitting while she beat it, and then Abu Bakr entered while she was beating it, then 'Ali entered while she was beating it, then 'Uthman entered while she was beating it, then when you entered O 'Umar and she put away the Duff",
