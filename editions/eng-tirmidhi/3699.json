Do you know that when (mount) Hira shook, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"Be firm O Hira! For there is none upon you except a Prophet, a Siddiq, and a martyr?\"' They said: 'Yes.' He said: 'I remind you by Allah! Do you know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, about the army of distress (Al-'Usrah): \"Who will spend something which shall be accepted (by Allah)?\" And the people were struggling during difficult times, so I prepared that army?' They said: 'Yes.' Then he said: 'I remind you by Allah. Do you know that no one drank from the well of Rumah but have to pay for it, then I bought it and made it for the rich, the poor, and the wayfarer?' They said: 'O Allah! Yes!'\" And he listed other things. This Hadith is Hasan Sahih Gharib from this route; as a narration of Abu 'Abdur-Rahman As-Sulami from 'Uthman",
