			"text": "Narrated Hudhaifah :\"My mother asked me: 'When is your planned time - meaning with the Prophet (ﷺ)?' So I said: 'I have not had a planned time to see him since such and such time.' She rebuked me, so I said to her: 'Let me go to the Prophet (ﷺ) so that I may perform Maghrib (prayer) with him, and ask him to seek forgiveness for you and I.' So I came to the Prophet (ﷺ), and I prayed Maghrib with him, then he prayed until he prayed Al-'Isha. Then he turned, and I followed him, and he heard my voice, and said: 'Who is this? Hudhaifah?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: \"What is your need, may Allah forgive you and your mother?' He said: 'Indeed, this is an angel that never descended to the earth ever before tonight. He sought permission from his Lord to greet me with peace and to give me the glad tidings that Fatimah is the chief of the women of Paradise, and that Al-Hasan and Al-Husain are the chiefs of the youths of the people of Paradise",
