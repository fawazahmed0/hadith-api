I prayed two Rak'ah for Zuhr with him while traveling and two Rak'ah after it, and two Rak'ah for Asr, and he did not pray anything after it. Maghrib while a resident and traveling is the same; three Rak'ah, it is not decreased as a resident nor while traveling. It is Witr of the day, and after it are two Rak'ah",
