If he wanted to depart after the sun's decline, he would hasten Asr to Zuhr, and pray Zuhr and Asr together, and then move it. If he wanted to depart before Maghrib he would delay Maghrib until he prayed it with Isha, and if he wanted to depart after Maghrib he would hasten Isha so that he would pray it along with Maghrib",
