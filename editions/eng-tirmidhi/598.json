So he said: 'When the sun appeared over there (east) like it appears here (west) at Asr, the Messenger of Allah would pray two Rak'ah, and when the sun appeared over there (east) like it appears here (west) at Zuhr, he would pray four Rak'ah. And he would pray four before Zuhr and two after it, and four before Asr separating between every two Rak'ah with At-Taslim upon the angels that are close (to Allah) and those who follow them among the believers, and the Muslims",
