He gave him something and he left. With that, begging was made unlawful, so the Messenger of Allah said: 'Begging is not lawful for the rich nor for the physically fit, except for the one who is severely poor or in perilous debt. And whoever begs the people (merely) to increase his wealth, then on the Day of Judgment (the wealth he begged for) will be lacerations on his face and heated coals from Hell will be provided for him to eat. Whoever wishes, let him take a little, and whoever wishes, then let him take a lot","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":7,"hadith":37}}]}
