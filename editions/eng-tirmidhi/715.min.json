He said: \"Come and eat.\" I said: 'I am fasting.' So he said: 'Come and I will narrate to you about the fast - or fasting. Indeed Allah Most High lifted (the fast and) half of the Salat from the traveler, and (He lifted) the fast - or fasting - from the pregnant person, or the breast-feeding person.' And by Allah! The Prophet said both of them or one of them. So woe to me! For I did not eat from the meal of the Prophet","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":8,"hadith":34}}]}
