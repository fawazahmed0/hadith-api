This is acted upon according to some of the people of knowledge.

(Abu Eisa said:) As for the saying of 'Ali: The Prophet (ﷺ) stood for the funeral and then sat, he means that the Prophet (ﷺ) would stand when he saw a funeral (procession), then he did not do so later, so he would not stand when he saw the funeral (procession)",
